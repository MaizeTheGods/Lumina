# Lumina - Virtual Library

Welcome to Lumina, a virtual library with a celestial, cosmic, and mystical aesthetic.

## Project Goal
To create a feature-rich platform for discovering and reading novels, similar in functionality to webnovel.com, but with a unique 'Lumina' aesthetic. The project will be hosted on Render and utilize databases for content and user data.

## Current Status
- Basic HTML structure in `index.html` including header, navigation, hero section, featured novels, and placeholder sections for all novels, genres, and user profile.
- Initial CSS styling in `css/style.css` to reflect the celestial/cosmic theme, including styles for novel cards.
- Basic JavaScript in `js/main.js` for console logs and smooth scrolling.
- This `README.md` file.

## Prerequisites
- **Node.js and npm**: While not strictly required for viewing the current static HTML, Node.js and npm will be essential for future development (e.g., managing dependencies, build tools, backend development). Please install from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Python (for simple preview)**: If you have Python installed, you can use its built-in HTTP server to preview the website locally.

## How to Preview
1.  Navigate to the project directory (`c:\Users\ramos\OneDrive\Desktop\lumina`) in your terminal.
2.  If you have Python installed, run the command: `python -m http.server`
3.  Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000` (or the port number indicated by the command).

## Next Steps
- Install Node.js and initialize `package.json` (`npm init -y`).
- Further refine the UI/UX design, especially for novel display and interaction.
- Plan and design database schemas (for novels, users, chapters, comments, likes, etc.).
- Start developing backend functionalities (e.g., API endpoints for fetching novels).
- Implement user authentication and profile management.
