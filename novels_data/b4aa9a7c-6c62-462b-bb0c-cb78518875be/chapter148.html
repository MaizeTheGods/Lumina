<p>The Lucky One VII</p><p>“…Go Yuri?”</p><p>Noh Do-hwa furrowed her brow.</p><p>“…Oh, the person I repeatedly warned you about? But how did it become that huge…?”</p><p>“The physical size doesn't matter much. That red tower is likely visible from anywhere on Earth.”</p><p>I stared at the horizon.</p><p>“You know how there are orbital elevators in science fiction? It's manifesting such a scene. That's the kind of anomaly we're dealing with.”</p><p>“Sigh…”</p><p>I had heard that Go Yuri crossed over to the Japanese archipelago.</p><p>Somehow, that incident snowballed into this disastrous result.</p><p>“There are ocean-level anomalies called 'Ya-o-yorozu no kami' in the Japanese archipelago. Just like Baekhwa High School's ghost stories are composed of 100 ghosts, Ya-o-yorozu no kami is literally composed of eight million anomalies.”</p><p>“That's a hell of a lot…”</p><p>“Yes. I don't know the details, but it seems Go Yuri took on the role of a 'calamity god' passed down from across the sea. Presumably, Go Yuri consumed Ya-o-yorozu no kami.”</p><p>This was not good.</p><p>Especially since the concept that 'anything can become a god' in the archipelago favored Go Yuri immensely. In fact, the only opponent who might match her was Yoo Ji-won.</p><p>“Are you saying she has become a god…?”</p><p>“At the very least, she can call herself a minor god. If she devours Ganges in India, who knows what might happen next.”</p><p>Perhaps, by actively bringing misfortune through the 'Hate Pill,' I managed to limit the disaster to 'only' this extent.</p><p>The neighboring region turned pink, so it was unlikely the Korean Peninsula would remain unscathed.</p><p>“Noh Do-hwa, I'm going to scout the Korean Peninsula.”</p><p>“…Sure. You'll probably come back in one piece this time since there's nothing left to cut off.”</p><p>“I'll try my best.”</p><p>I boarded the Savoia S-21 seaplane and set off for the Korean Peninsula.</p><p>This plane was modeled after the one in Studio Ghibli's Porco Rosso and was a kind of anomaly itself. It was sturdier in the void than in reality.</p><p>It even had some resistance to 'brainwashing' and 'hypnosis,' reminiscent of scenes from the original animation.</p><p>Vroom—</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>Unlike the original, this biplane flew with a hum of its engine.</p><p>Despite the 50% chance of the engine stalling mid-flight, it was still much safer than staying on the ground.</p><p>“…It's over.”</p><p>The Korean Peninsula was also devastated.</p><p>The 'Black Wall' that expanded from Manchuria had now consumed all of North Korea.</p><p>The alien structures spewed black sludge continuously, covering everything around. From there, anomalies poured out incessantly.</p><p>-Creeeeak.</p><p>-Craaak, craak.</p><p>The aliens that had numbered 120 upon arrival had multiplied like zerglings.</p><p>Their forms had changed too. Once resembling armored beings, they now looked more like grotesque 'alien lifeforms,' akin to Ultralisk or Hydralisk from StarCraft.</p><p>It seemed the Monster Wave and aliens had fused.</p><p>Considering how clichés often end with giants breaking walls and soldiers defending them, a fusion of DNA was almost expected.</p><p>‘Busan is... barely recognizable.’</p><p>Busan Station, the stronghold of the Samsin World, and the headquarters of the National Road Management Corps were all destroyed, emitting ominous smoke.</p><p>I wondered what had happened to Yoo Ji-won.</p><p>In case of emergencies, we had established a protocol to evacuate to Inunaki Tunnel. The Saintess, Lee Ha-yul, Sim Ah-ryeon, and Seo Gyu knew the protocol.</p><p>“Saintess? Are you watching?”</p><p>No response.</p><p>There was no answer.</p><p>“……”</p><p>I couldn't tell if the Saintess was dead or just pretending to wait for me to land and ambush me. Given the ongoing misfortune brought by the 'Hate Pill,' nothing was certain. I had to consider the worst-case scenario that she had fallen as an executor.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>A sound of gunfire erupted from somewhere.</p><p>I tensed, thinking it was anti-aircraft fire, but no weapon firing the shots was visible.</p><p>It was just like the cannon sounds that echoed from Saipan's beach. The sound existed, but not the source.</p><p>Boom! Boom!</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>The bombardment sounds peaked near the Nakdong River. It took me a moment to realize it was a reenactment of a war.</p><p>The 'Korean War' was unfolding across the Korean Peninsula. Under the guise of ideology, people hunted each other with the cold edge of an axe, distinguishing between 'us' and 'them.'</p><p>But just like the cliffs of Saipan, the hunters and the hunted were all part of the anomalies' play. No truly living humans were found.</p><p>Even the connection to the Undertaker's gossip network was severed.</p><p>‘Perhaps, to others, the existence of a regressor like me was a massive stroke of luck.’</p><p>Such a thought crossed my mind.</p><p>‘If so, Old Man Scho's repeated deaths would be equally immense misfortune for others. Perhaps the ‘Total Luck Law’ balanced things without us realizing it.’</p><p>-Craaak?</p><p>The aliens spotted me and began scanning the skies.</p><p>Even though this plane was an anomaly, it couldn't withstand UFOs from an SF universe.</p><p>Before the aliens could shoot me down, I altered my course and returned to Saipan.</p><p>“Hmm…”</p><p>Noh Do-hwa was sitting in the beach hut.</p><p>She glanced at me.</p><p>“Well, you came back in one piece.”</p><p>Noh Do-hwa brewed coffee with beans she had brought from Busan and handed me a cup.</p><p>And she asked nothing.</p><p>I always appreciated her silence.</p><p>Incidentally, Noh Do-hwa made terrible coffee despite appearances.</p><p>Though I had tried to keep a cheerful tone, I must confess honestly.</p><p>In the 590th cycle, my mental state was quite shaken.</p><p>No, ‘quite’ was too mild. It was considerably shaken.</p><p>‘Did I use the Monkey's Paw too hastily?’</p><p>Of course, I had a goal that necessitated testing the Monkey's Paw.</p><p>As will be revealed in the next stories, there was an anomaly I could only defeat with the Monkey's Paw.</p><p>But at that point, it was a future matter. Until my experiment's significance was proven, my mind was inevitably cornered in the 590th cycle.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>‘Yes. This anxiety itself is one of the emotions bringing me misfortune.’</p><p>So I let go.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, I would have used various methods to restore my mental state. I might have guided the aliens to the Japanese archipelago to enjoy a Go Yuri vs. aliens matchup.</p><p>But in the 590th cycle, I aimed to become as unfortunate as possible.</p><p>Thus, I tormented myself.</p><p>‘Even though I sought a way to counter the god, relying on the Total Luck Law was foolish. The disaster was my choice.’</p><p>‘I should have warned my comrades in advance. But no, Dok-seo's mind was corrupted anyway. The result would have been the same.’</p><p>‘Really? The Saintess has a much stronger mental state than Dok-seo. If I had explained my purpose and intentions...’</p><p>‘How could the Saintess have countered the interference of three anomalies: the Savior, the Monkey's Paw, and the Hate Pill?’</p><p>‘I shouldn't have done it.’</p><p>Regret. Self-reproach. Fantasizing about IFs.</p><p>The thoughts that constantly drove humans to misfortune were always ‘I shouldn't have done that.’</p><p>A master of mental management is also a genius of mental destruction. I expertly tortured myself.</p><p>I frequently flew around the ruined world, reminding myself, 'This is all due to my wrong choices.'</p><p>“...…”</p><p>Noh Do-hwa quietly watched me.</p><p>Honestly, if I truly wanted to be unfortunate, I should have driven her away.</p><p>But I couldn't bring myself to expel Noh Do-hwa from the beach hut.</p><p>In the 590th cycle, I realized that my psyche unknowingly relied on Noh Do-hwa.</p><p>‘Even in my subconscious, I never saw a corrupted Noh Do-hwa.’</p><p>The uncorruptible.</p><p>Perhaps Noh Do-hwa had such a characteristic?</p><p>Maybe that's why she was immune to the Hate Pill's effects?</p><p>—Rationally, that was impossible.</p><p>If Noh Do-hwa had true [mental immunity], she should have resisted Go Yuri's brainwashing. Over many cycles, such behavior was not observed.</p><p>‘Still, she might be more resistant to the Hated Pill than others.’</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>At that time, I indulged in such fantasies.</p><p>‘Maybe the Hate Pill has an effect I didn't know about. Perhaps the more Noh Do-hwa hated me, the more she felt a twisted sense of friendship?’</p><p>‘Otherwise, why would she suggest leaving with me right after resigning from the National Road Management Corps? Was Noh Do-hwa the type to make such a proposal voluntarily?’</p><p>Fantasies. Fantasies. More fantasies.</p><p>Somewhere deep in my heart, a part of me yearned to rely on someone, indulging that desire.</p><p>The saying by Native Americans was true. The human mind is like a hungry wolf; the more you feed it, the stronger it grows.</p><p>My heart grew into a miserable wolf.</p><p>‘The Savior anomaly's usage, the validation of the Monkey's Paw and the Hate Pill, and Noh Do-hwa's characteristics.’</p><p>‘I've gained enough from the 590th cycle.’</p><p>‘From the start, I intended this to be a semi-vacation cycle.’</p><p>I grew kinder to Noh Do-hwa.</p><p>Using our limited resources, I made delicious meals. As Noh Do-hwa once said in the 100th cycle, my cooking skills were Michelin 4-star chef level.</p><p>Even amidst the cannon sounds and screams in Saipan, I found charming paths for walks with Noh Do-hwa.</p><p>In short, I used various means to gain Noh Do-hwa's favor.</p><p>“Hmm…”</p><p>Despite my desperate mental efforts, Noh Do-hwa said little.</p><p>No.</p><p>“Today's coffee is good.”</p><p>She grew kinder.</p><p>Her sharp remarks softened, and her usual sneer turned into a more gentle smile.</p><p>She even expressed interest in learning to cook, asking me for lessons, and chatted during our walks.</p><p>Simple daily life. Ordinary joys.</p><p>With no place to attach myself, my mind clung to Noh Do-hwa's small kindnesses.</p><p>A year passed.</p><p>Noh Do-hwa became my sole source of happiness.</p><p>“Good night, Undertaker…”</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>“Ah, yes. You too, good night, Craftsmaster.”</p><p>As usual, I fell asleep in the hut's bedroom.</p><p>And when I woke up.</p><p>“Ah.”</p><p>Noh Do-hwa's voice was close.</p><p>“Oh dear, you woke up…?”</p><p>A bit too close.</p><p>Noh Do-hwa was on top of me, her weight pressing down.</p><p>“You can go back to sleep if you want…”</p><p>But I couldn't.</p><p>Thud.</p><p>The main pressure point was my neck.</p><p>The former public servant, Craftsmaster, and manager who once called herself my accomplice, was now strangling me with a faint smile.</p><p>“...…”</p><p>I opened my mouth but no words came out.</p><p>The opponent was Noh Do-hwa, the last person you'd expect to be mentioned purely based on combat power among the awakened.</p><p>If I wanted, I could immediately shake off her hands.</p><p>But looking into her black eyes up close, I saw they were saying something else.</p><p>“Please don't resist…”</p><p>Her lips spoke as well.</p><p>“It would be troublesome. The moment you activate your aura, I'll take my own life. You wouldn't want that, would you?”</p><p>“...…”</p><p>“Of course, you could cut off my limbs and prevent me from doing so… But I doubt you'd go that far.”</p><p>Noh Do-hwa's grip tightened on my neck.</p><p>I choked, bubbles forming in my throat.</p><p>I tried moving my limbs, but my prosthetic arms and legs, installed by Noh Do-hwa, didn't budge.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>“Wh-Why…?”</p><p>“Ah, sorry. I tampered with them a bit during assembly.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“Oh. You’re wondering since when? Well, considering your limited remaining lifespan, I'll tell you. From the moment the awakened went berserk in the Busan bunker… I started thinking right away…”</p><p>Noh Do-hwa smirked.</p><p>Her smile was darker than ever before, like poison.</p><p>Her venom seeped from her eyes to her hands, strangling my breath.</p><p>“Your choice to embrace misfortune made me worry. Was it possible for you, who finds happiness in small things, to become truly unfortunate…?”</p><p>Squeeze.</p><p>“You're a person who can find joy in anything. You must have worked hard to become like that. I can only imagine how awful the life of a regressor must have been…”</p><p>Press.</p><p>“Your mental barriers are sturdy. If breaking them was my goal, staying in Korea as the head of the National Road Management Corps was counterproductive…”</p><p>Pressure.</p><p>“So, I quit…”</p><p>Yu Ji-won was capable.</p><p>But her capabilities shone most as a deputy. As the leader of a large organization, her tendency to view everything and everyone as tools would cause problems.</p><p>Managing the National Road Management Corps, which required negotiating with numerous guilds, would spiral out of control under Yoo Ji-won's leadership.</p><p>Cheon Yo-hwa, the guild master of Baekhwa, braving the sea alone and getting stranded, was a sign of the upcoming chaos.</p><p>Noh Do-hwa had been waiting for this.</p><p>“You planned the organization so meticulously, raised it, and now the Korean Peninsula is in shambles, bringing you significant misfortune…”</p><p>It didn’t end there.</p><p>“While others tried to beat you up, I saw that such straightforward attacks wouldn’t deal a decisive blow. It was a golden opportunity for me.”</p><p>Opportunity. What kind?</p><p>“Undertaker.”</p><p>Noh Do-hwa leaned closer.</p><p>Her pitch-black eyes, as dark as a well.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>Her eyes, devoid of any light, stared down at me.</p><p>“You ruined my life.”</p><p>She whispered in my ear.</p><p>“You dragged me into the National Road Management Corps when I only wanted to live quietly. You claimed you wanted to save the world... 500 times? 600 times? How many more times do you plan to make me suffer…?”</p><p>“...…”</p><p>“Bastard.”</p><p>Her poison seeped into me.</p><p>“Undertaker. I hate you. I always have, and I always will. If you feel guilty, even a little, for ruining my life…”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“Please, die here and now.”</p><p>My body trembled.</p><p>It was hard to tell if it was due to the diminishing oxygen or Noh Do-hwa’s venomous intent.</p><p>-Huikikikkik.</p><p>The Monkey's Paw wailed in the void.</p><p>The roof beams of the hut collapsed, aiming to crush Noh Do-hwa. The Monkey's Paw, trying to eradicate the source of my misfortune, was thrashing.</p><p>I summoned my aura and shattered the beam. It disintegrated without a sound, and Noh Do-hwa smiled softly.</p><p>My vision blurred.</p><p>Through the haze, I saw Noh Do-hwa lowering her head further.</p><p>“How is it…?”</p><p>She whispered.</p><p>“Is my killing you sufficient misfortune for you…?”</p><p>I wanted to laugh.</p><p>Of course.</p><p>But I couldn’t move my lips, so in the blackened vision, I met my end.</p><p>It was my 590th death.</p><p>There is a small epilogue.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>To summarize, the Monkey's Paw didn't pursue me beyond the regression to collect its debt.</p><p>The final 'misfortune' gifted by Noh Do-hwa was significant enough even for the Monkey's Paw.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>The [Total Luck Law], which might have grown into an ocean-class threat, was safely dealt with.</p><p>“...? What are you staring at?”</p><p>“Nothing.”</p><p>I debated whether to tell Noh Do-hwa about the previous cycle but decided against it.</p><p>If I did, she might genuinely despise me.</p><p>There was no need to invite misfortune this cycle too.</p><p>“Hm?”</p><p>Noh Do-hwa, sitting far away at her desk, tilted her head.</p><p>She got up, walked over, and frowned as she looked up at me.</p><p>“What's this all of a sudden?”</p><p>“…Hmm. Undertaker, it seems you're starting to go bald.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>What nonsense was that?</p><p>“Bald? In my 591 regressions, I've never lost a single hair. My hair is very healthy.”</p><p>“Really? Well, I must be mistaken. Still, it’s better to be cautious…”</p><p>Ten years later.</p><p>When I looked in the mirror, I saw that Noh Do-hwa’s warning was accurate. My hair was thinning in an M-shaped pattern.</p><p>“...…”</p><p>As if it were the final payment for the misfortune I owed.</p><p>-Uikiikik.</p><p>I must emphasize once more.</p><p>Anomalies were truly dangerous.</p><p>Footnotes:</p>
