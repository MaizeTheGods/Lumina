<p>Eschatologist III</p><p>"Don’t worry too much, guild leader," Go Yuri said with a bittersweet smile, as if she was genuinely concerned about me.</p><p>"You see, this place is a well of dreams descended through you. I am merely a role within the dream within a dream, a manifestation of your subconscious. I have nothing to do with the real me."</p><p>"...So, you're just an illusion?"</p><p>"Yes. If I had to put it, it's likely your fears and aversions manifesting. It's quite sad that your unconscious fears have taken my form..."</p><p>Go Yuri lowered her eyes sadly, but I couldn't let my guard down.</p><p>Imagine Godzilla wagging its tail, asking to be petted. Even a light novel protagonist equipped with the 'pat → conquer' internal protocol might question the magic in their hand.</p><p>"Really, it wouldn't make sense if I weren't an illusion. No matter how mysterious I am to you, it’s absurd for me to sit on a cloud or be 600 meters underground, right?"</p><p>"......"</p><p>"All these are just manifestations of your fear. The fact that I call you ‘guild leader’ is itself strange. Because, as you know..."</p><p>"...You never accepted me as guild leader. That title only exists in my memories."</p><p>"Exactly!"</p><p>What should I do?</p><p>Trusting Go Yuri was out of the question. I might as well believe that the UFO which fell into the East Sea was an ambassador for friendly interstellar relations.</p><p>But it was also true that I couldn't escape from here.</p><p>I had to wait for the Tutorial Fairies to rescue me or find a way out myself.</p><p>Until then, like it or not, Go Yuri would be closely following me.</p><p>"Besides, I can guide you here."</p><p>"Guide? That's quite a welcome offer. The guide I hired was just assassinated."</p><p>"Ahaha. I'm sorry, but wouldn't a local guide be more reliable than an outsider?"</p><p>Go Yuri clasped her hands behind her back and leaned closer.</p><p>"The Baku are merely bridges between dreams and reality. It’s hard to call them completely ‘from this side.’ But I, formed from your unconscious, have always existed here."</p><p>"......"</p><p>"I know almost everything that happens here. guild leader, you came to explore the nightmares, right? I can guide you far better than any Baku."</p><p>I was silent for a moment.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>"...There are conditions."</p><p>"Yes. Please tell me anything."</p><p>"Don’t try to win my favor unnecessarily. Don’t get too close. And don't kill any Baku without warning like you did before. If you violate these conditions, I will escape by any means necessary."</p><p>What would happen if I ended my life in this dream?</p><p>It was uncertain, but it was worth a try, simply because it was an unknown method of death to me.</p><p>Go Yuri’s smile turned a bit complicated.</p><p>"Understood, guild leader. I will try my best. However..."</p><p>"However?"</p><p>"Uh, nothing. This place is dangerous, so we should hurry out."</p><p>Go Yuri turned around. The light tapping of her loafers echoed through the waiting room.</p><p>"Follow me. I'll show you the nightmares."</p><p>As soon as we stepped out of Busan Station, the scene before us was a void.</p><p>Let me remind you of the terror of the void.</p><p>In our reality, before the apocalypse, ‘space and time’ were always orderly. When you looked left, you saw the left. When you stepped right, you moved to the right.</p><p>But the void is different.</p><p>There, normal space-time and physical laws mean nothing.</p><p>Especially in a deep void.</p><p>"…!"</p><p>As soon as I stepped outside Busan Station, my head felt dizzy.</p><p>Far ahead, about 200 meters away, a yellow traffic light was standing. It caught my attention, and the next moment, it was right in front of me.</p><p>Blink, blink, blink—</p><p>The yellow light of the traffic signal flashed fiercely before my eyes. When I blinked again, the traffic light had disappeared.</p><p>"…..."</p><p>Waaah!</p><p>Somewhere, I heard children crying. Turning around, it was just a grassy field. The grass swayed in the wind, and with each sway, it wailed like a baby.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>"There, there."</p><p>A crone was crouched in a flowerbed, picking azalea buds. Waaah! Red blood gushed out as the buds were picked, and the crying grew louder. The crone gently stroked the azalea petals as if soothing a baby, her nails stained with bright red flower juice.</p><p>"......"</p><p>I steadied my breathing.</p><p>In the midst of the endlessly echoing signal light’s blinking, the flower baby's crying, and the crone’s stroking, I focused solely on the path I walked.</p><p>Next to me, Go Yuri blinked.</p><p>"Wow. You’re amazing. You’re really maintaining your self-awareness. How do you do it?"</p><p>"...It’s a secret. Where are the nightmares?"</p><p>"Ah, right over there."</p><p>Go Yuri pointed.</p><p>I turned my gaze naturally and held my breath.</p><p>"What is that...?"</p><p>There, a familiar yet unfamiliar scene unfolded.</p><p>The building was familiar. The National Road Management Corps Headquarters. It stood tall like the Tower of Babel, a landmark of Busan.</p><p>In a cycle where Busan turned into a ‘Utopia,’ I had watched fireworks with Dang Seo-rin from the terrace.</p><p>"Ah――Ah――Ah―――"</p><p>Even now, in this dream, Dang Seo-rin was there.</p><p>Not on the terrace, but hanging from the spire.</p><p>Dang Seo-rin was crucified, nails driven through her wrists and ankles. It was as if she was subjected to a witch trial, bleeding from her limbs, singing without end.</p><p>My limbs grew pale.</p><p>But the horrific sight didn’t end there.</p><p>"――Ah――Ah――"</p><p>Below Dang Seo-rin, another person was crucified.</p><p>It was Sim Ah-ryeon.</p><p>She followed her master, singing in Latin, using the techniques Dang Seo-rin had taught her.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>Their faces were expressionless. The duo’s acapella resonated endlessly through the night sky, shaking the entire universe.</p><p>"What on earth…?"</p><p>"You already know, don’t you?" Go Yuri said.</p><p>"It’s a perpetual motion machine. The ‘Great Witch’ sings, burning her lifespan. Though it’s an ability bound to end someday, the story changes when ‘Saintess of the North’ joins."</p><p>"......"</p><p>"When the Great Witch's lifespan runs out, the Saintess of the North can refill it. This creates an endless fuel for the dream."</p><p>"......"</p><p>"The Great Witch dies every time she sings, resurrects, and dies again, endlessly singing for the world’s peace. That’s the nightmare."</p><p>I immediately swung my sword.</p><p>The Tower of Babel collapsed. The singing of Dang Seo-rin and Sim Ah-ryeon was engulfed by the sound of the falling tower.</p><p>Perhaps it was just my imagination, but it felt as though they looked at me, letting out a brief, silent cry before disappearing into the dust cloud.</p><p>My heart pounded.</p><p>But the nightmare wasn’t over.</p><p>"...You can’t kill dreams, guild leader."</p><p>Go Yuri said, looking troubled.</p><p>"As I mentioned, these nightmares are just your fears manifested. A wise person like you must have imagined at least once, right? That if those two fell together, an eternal peaceful utopia might be created."</p><p>"...What a horrible hobby. I would never choose that."</p><p>"Yes. And this place could be called a trash bin of possibilities you didn’t choose."</p><p>"......"</p><p>"Worlds after bad endings, parallel worlds’ fates, or simply nightmares. Bad tastes."</p><p>Tap. Go Yuri started walking.</p><p>The surroundings changed.</p><p>Sejong City turned into a white sand desert, and at its center, Cheon Yo-hwa and Lee Ha-yul sat facing each other.</p><p>Even from a far distance, their conversation was oddly clear.</p><p>"...But, Teacher sometimes randomly brings up comparisons to “Records of the Grand Historian” and “Water Margin”. Shouldn’t we insert that knowledge into him?"</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>"Disagree. Prefer to pursue a perfect brother rather than the current one."</p><p>"Wow... Ha-yul, sometimes our tastes match, and sometimes they don’t."</p><p>"Agree. Can’t understand why you follow outdated realism."</p><p>"What? Doll otaku."</p><p>They chatted softly.</p><p>It should have been a heartwarming scene, but my mouth felt dry.</p><p>Creak—</p><p>Something was between Cheon Yo-hwa and Lee Ha-yul. It was ‘me.’</p><p>A doll resembling the Undertaker, my corpse, stood crooked between them.</p><p>"Then let’s omit “Records of the Grand Historian” and “Water Margin” and just insert “Romance of the Three Kingdoms”. Without that, it’s hard to call him teacher!"</p><p>"Agree."</p><p>Creak. Creak.</p><p>Cheon Yo-hwa was inputting data into my corpse. Like turning a zombie into an AI judge.</p><p>The body of the ‘Undertaker,’ with its limbs and all muscles, was connected to Lee Ha-yul’s puppet strings.</p><p>The ‘Undertaker’ opened its mouth.</p><p>-You guys… What do you really think of humans? I’ve always told you, Yo-hwa. You need to view humans with more warmth.</p><p>"Wow! It’s just like teacher!"</p><p>-And Ha-yul. I’ve told you not to play with living people like dolls. No, not even with dead people.</p><p>"Satisfied."</p><p>They were cheerful.</p><p>In the white desert world, only those two continued their puppet play forever.</p><p>The scene seemed so distant.</p><p>"That’s another bad ending."</p><p>Go Yuri whispered beside me.</p><p>"When the Infinite Void was unleashed, covering the world, only a small oasis was allowed for Cheon Yo-hwa and the Puppeteer."</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>"......"</p><p>"Please, whatever you do, don’t approach them? Though they seem normal, those versions of Cheon Yo-hwa and the Puppeteer are extremely corrupted. They’re anomalies capable of destroying the world alone… Guild leader?"</p><p>I ignored Go Yuri’s warning.</p><p>Crunch. My foot sank into the sand.</p><p>With just one step, Cheon Yo-hwa and Lee Ha-yul’s gazes instantly focused on me.</p><p>"......"</p><p>"......"</p><p>They stared intently.</p><p>My disciples looked at me. I walked towards them slowly but surely.</p><p>As I approached, their faces turned completely expressionless, as if they had never been chatting happily.</p><p>I stood before them.</p><p>And I hugged them.</p><p>As tightly as I could without breaking them.</p><p>"Yo-hwa."</p><p>"......"</p><p>"Ha-yul."</p><p>"......"</p><p>"You shouldn’t be here. Let’s go home, kids. Let’s go home..."</p><p>"......"</p><p>"......"</p><p>Slowly, Yo-hwa and Ha-yul’s forms crumbled in my embrace. White sand became a sandstorm and scattered.</p><p>Even the desert itself disappeared in the wind. I found myself sitting in the middle of a cracked asphalt road.</p><p>"That’s amazing…"</p><p>Go Yuri murmured.</p><p>"Really, how do you maintain your self-awareness so firmly? Here, you could indulge your desires. It’s a place where that’s inevitable."</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>"It’s nothing special. I sometimes take a vacation to let go."</p><p>"Even vacations are just a means to return to reality, right? Why do you never completely let go? Even once. Letting go wouldn’t mean anyone could harm you."</p><p>If I could answer that my spirit was strong enough, it might have felt a bit better.</p><p>But that wasn’t the answer.</p><p>For one to become strong, it’s always insufficient to rely on one’s own reasons; the presence of others is necessary.</p><p>The reason I could hold out strongly.</p><p>“—Ah.”</p><p>It was paradoxically because there always existed ‘others who crumbled before me.’</p><p>"We’re in trouble, guild leader. That ‘ending’ is really dangerous."</p><p>"......"</p><p>"It’s one of the most perilous beings in this apocalyptic world. I recommend you escape. Unlike Cheon Yo-hwa or the Puppeteer, it won’t be easy to give it a burial."</p><p>Even before Go Yuri’s warning, I sensed something ominous approaching.</p><p>‘Something’ was coming our way.</p><p>The hair on my head stood up. My nape, always ahead of my senses in detecting threats, prickled fiercely.</p><p>I strengthened my vision with aura. Beyond the forest of broken buildings, it was walking toward us.</p><p>"Hah."</p><p>Seeing the figure, I couldn’t help but laugh bitterly.</p><p>Indeed.</p><p>If this place was my nightmare and the collective unconscious of humanity, if it gathered ‘the worst bad endings’ as Go Yuri said, then naturally, it would include such an ending.</p><p>"Really, this old man never does anything helpful in life…"</p><p>Emit Schopenhauer.</p><p>My long-time comrade.</p><p>Awakener Alias: Sword Star.</p><p>Corrupted Alias: Sword Demon.</p><p>The swordsman, born with the ultimate martial talent, now exuded an aura incomparably more powerful than when he was alive, approaching me.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>Footnotes:</p>
