<p>Troublemaker ⅠⅠ</p><p>Thanks to the Saintess, I was able to pinpoint the location of OldManGoryeo.</p><p>I would like to write that I immediately moved to defeat OldManGoryeo, but in reality, it took a bit more time.</p><p>A regressor's schedule is as tight as that of an A-list actor who just started being hailed as a national treasure.</p><p>No matter how dastardly OldManGoryeo was, I had much more urgent matters at hand. I had to upload the 'Aura Demonstration Video (Advanced)' under an alt-account on SG Net, reorganize the Korean Awakeners' Federation, tour famous eateries in Busan, and prepare for the meteor shower, among other things...</p><p>It's no joke. My calendar was jam-packed until the seventh year, if we counted from the regressor starting point.</p><p>It was nearly fifteen days later when I eventually managed to find some time to meet with iJoinedToday, and even that was a tight squeeze into into my schedule.</p><p>I had the Saintess—or more precisely, the Constellation she was enacting, 'The Saintess of National Salvation'—arrange the meeting place and time.</p><p>When I arrived at our designated location, there stood a muscular young man with broad shoulders.</p><p>“Mr. iJoinedToday?”</p><p>“Oh, ah, are you Mr. ZERO_SUGAR?”</p><p>“Yes. Nice to meet you. Please feel free to call me Undertaker.”</p><p>“Pleased to meet you. I am Lee Ju-ho.”</p><p>We shook hands.</p><p>A strong grip. I could feel the all-muscle, no-fat physique of someone who forged their path through this harsh world.</p><p>As an aside, I personally believe that one can tell more about a person from their hands than their face.</p><p>“Are you perhaps a teacher by any chance?” I asked, sneaking a glance over his shoulder.</p><p>“Ah—” Lee Ju-ho laughed awkwardly.</p><p>Our meeting place was an elementary school playground. Though the more accurate description would be a split-in-half elementary school.</p><p><em>Peekaboo.</em></p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>Tiny children were stealthily keeping tabs on us. If a used car dealer had seen the junk those kids were playing spy in, they would have already issued a junkyard disposal for the whole pile. When our eyes met, they scurried off to hide like squirrels.</p><p>How adorable.</p><p>Lee Ju-ho scratched his head. “Yes, well... These elementary students are currently under my care.”</p><p>“How commendable, especially in these times. May I call you a teacher?”</p><p>“Oh, no need for formalities. Please, just call me however you see fit. I wasn’t originally a teacher.”</p><p>Lee Ju-ho gave a wry smile.</p><p>“I was just a math tutor getting paid at a tutoring academy... Somehow, there wasn’t anyone left to take up the podium. In the mornings, I finish guild tasks, and in the afternoon I juggle teaching. Another member takes care of being the nurse and art teacher, as well as managing the library.”</p><p>“Oh...”</p><p>Let me just say that by this point, my fondness for Lee Ju-ho had already surpassed Lv. 5.</p><p>What was this young man? An angel?</p><p>“Ah. By the way, Mr. ZERO_SUGAR, sir, it must have been hard traveling in this hot weather. Would you like something to drink...?” Lee Ju-ho complemented his statement by offering a ZERO Coke beverage.</p><p>Since the Gate incident, that sort of commercial product had been elevated to a precious treat. Yet he had deliberately prepared a zero-calorie drink for me, probably because my ID was ‘ZERO_SUGAR’.</p><p>“Oh...”</p><p>Fondness Lv. 6: surpassed.</p><p>“What a thought... But I would never refuse. I’ll gladly drink it.”</p><p>“Haha, I’m glad. I thought you’d like it.”</p><p>“Indeed. It's even more of a treat since it’s been a while. And I apologize for being late to say this, but I offer my condolences.”</p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>We then sat side by side on a bench in the half-destroyed elementary school playground.</p><p>Once again, the young man’s name was Lee Ju-ho.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>He was active around Pocheon-Cheorwon. We happened to be meeting in Pocheon as well.</p><p>The guild to which Lee Ju-ho belonged could not compare to AAA-class guilds like Samcheon or Baekhwa, but it was solid in its own right. However, as I recall, it was one of those mid-size guilds that later mysteriously disappeared. In this day and age, his guild wasn’t the only one.</p><p>“So, Mr. Undertaker...”</p><p>After some initial chitchat, Lee Ju-ho looked at me.</p><p>“You mentioned that you had information about OldManGoryeo.”</p><p>“Yes, that’s correct.”</p><p>Lee Ju-ho’s black eyes darkened, a burning anger for the father he loved. He licked his lips, then asked, “Will you help me kill that bastard?”</p><p>Hmm.</p><p>I set down the aluminum can. “Whether to kill him is your decision, Mr. Lee Ju-ho. My role is to guide you to your destination.”</p><p>“By destination, you mean...?”</p><p>“Of course, the place where OldManGoryeo lives.”</p><p>Lee Ju-ho’s eyes widened. “You know where that bastard lives?!”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“How on earth— Ah. Perhaps...?”</p><p>The words Lee Ju-ho swallowed must have been asking if I was an acquaintance of OldManGoryeo.</p><p>“Do not worry," I assured, shaking my head. "I have never even met the man, let alone made his acquaintance.”</p><p>“Ah.”</p><p>Though it would later turn out that I had inadvertently lied.</p><p>“Forgive me. I didn’t mean to doubt you, ZERO_SUGAR, sir. But how did you manage to locate him...?”</p><p>That was, of course, thanks to the Saintess and her clairvoyant ability. If you keep listening to my story, you’ll gradually realize that the Saintess is truly a cheat-level Awakener.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>“I cannot tell you, but let me hint that it was thanks to my awakening ability and the Constellation I personally serve.”</p><p>“Ah...”</p><p>“Will you follow me?”</p><p>As I stood from the bench, Lee Ju-ho also got to his feet, albeit hesitantly. He reflexively looked towards the direction of the abandoned school, where the children were hiding.</p><p>“Ah, um, I didn’t know it would come to this... I didn’t settle things before coming. I have guild tasks and school tasks to handle. I’m really sorry, but could you possibly wait just a little longer?”</p><p>“No, there’s no need for that.”</p><p>“No?”</p><p>I smiled brightly. “It’s not far at all from here.”</p><p>I had specifically adjusted my busy regressor-schedule to give myself some leeway in intervening in this case.</p><p>“If it’s close, how close is it?”</p><p>“Pocheon. Mr. Lee Ju-ho, you and OldManGoryeo are actually from the same neighborhood.”</p><p>Lee Ju-ho went silent as his jaw dropped.</p><p>Why hide it?</p><p>This case was a simple quest that could be solved with just one proper attempt.</p><p>[Turn right into the alley.]</p><p>[Then it's left into the next alley.]</p><p>[Keep going straight.]</p><p>The performance of the 'Saintess', a limited edition navigation product that I alone could use in the whole world, allowed me to find my way even with my eyes closed.</p><p>“......”</p><p>Meanwhile, Lee Ju-ho, who was following me, never stopped expressing his open confusion.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>“Are you alright?” I asked.</p><p>“Ah, yes. It's just... This information was so unexpected...”</p><p>He was understandably shocked.</p><p>Connecting to SG Net meant OldManGoryeo was also an Awakener. And though Pocheon was not a major city, all the Awakeners there would know each other.</p><p>“Oh! Team Leader Ju-ho!”</p><p>Sure enough, as we walked down the street, village patrol members who recognized Lee Ju-ho approached us.</p><p>Nowadays, a patrol team was a must-have in every village. In keeping with the latest trends, the patrol members looked at me, a stranger, with particular suspicion.</p><p>“Excuse me, but what brings you to this neighborhood?”</p><p>Lee Ju-ho stepped forward. “Oh, about that... Just taking a walk with an old hometown friend.”</p><p>“Your hometown friend? Wow. Friendships like that are rare these days.” The patrol member opened the road barrier. “Well, if he’s an associate of Team Leader Ju-ho, it should be fine. Please go ahead.”</p><p>After we passed through the security checkpoint, the streets became noticeably tidier. This must be the affluent area of Pocheon, akin to Gangnam Cheongdam-dong. Although, the original Cheongdam-dong had been turned into ruins.</p><p>“Excuse me, Mr. ZERO_SUGAR, sir. Is this really the place?” Lee Ju-ho's voice, which had already been hesitant before we entered this neighborhood, began to tremble even more.</p><p>“Why? Are you feeling uneasy?”</p><p>“To be honest... Yes. This area is primarily where our guild's Awakeners live. There isn’t a single member from another guild here.”</p><p>“Is that so? Then you should brace yourself.”</p><p>“......”</p><p>Frankly, whether Lee Ju-ho was prepared or not didn’t matter much to me. After all, I had come all this way just to see how impressively the facial muscles of OldManGoryeo could be re-arranged.</p><p>Unlike Lee Ju-ho, I didn't particularly intend to kill OldManGoryeo. A good beating and a warning to 'never troll on the internet again' would suffice.</p><p>“This is the place.”</p><p>We soon arrived in front of a house. Red bricks. A small front yard. It wasn’t particularly luxurious, but living in a detached house rather than a communal residence in these times was a sign of privileged status.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>Lee Ju-ho's eyes flickered over the building restlessly. It seemed it was indeed the house of an acquaintance.</p><p>“Good heavens.”</p><p>“This is the location given by my Constellation. You know of her, The Saintess of National Salvation, right? Among the Constellations, she is the most trustworthy. Let’s go take a look at his face now.”</p><p>“ZERO_SUGAR, sir, just a moment...!”</p><p>Lee Ju-ho tried to grab my shoulder, but by then, I had already stormed into the mansion.</p><p>Fitting for an Awakener’s hideout, the mansion was equipped with various security devices. However, I infiltrated them as easily as a summer mosquito.</p><p>Why? Because I, the regressor, was the very person who initially proposed and implemented these security designs.</p><p>Passwords? Traps? Puppeteer’s special spider webs? They all crumbled before me, the copyright holder, in less than a second.</p><p>“No, what―”</p><p>The sound of Lee Ju-ho's astonishment echoed behind me, but I ignored it. These kinds of infiltration operations needed to be quick and decisive, and once initiated, it was best to see them through without looking back.</p><p>If this were a game, my profile would probably read [First Profession: Regressor], [Second Profession: Assassin (Thief)].</p><p>I reached the heart of OldManGoryeo’s hideout in an instant.</p><p>“Heh... Here's blue, heehee...”</p><p>OldManGoryeo was busy painting on a canvas, so completely absorbed in his art, that he hadn’t noticed my intrusion at all.</p><p>Only once I stepped up right behind him did his ears finally twitch to attention.</p><p>“Huh? Who...?”</p><p>A critical hit to the nape. With an optional aura boost.</p><p>“Eeek.”</p><p><em>Thump.</em></p><p>A woman in a white doctor’s coat went limp. Steering her clear of the paint cans so that she crumbled to the floor was my final act of consideration.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>OldManGoryeo was, in fact, a woman.</p><p>Target secured, mission accomplished.</p><p>That was easy.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>The real problem started then.</p><p>Knocking OldManGoryeo out was fine, but taking in her face came with a surprise.</p><p>What in the world―</p><p>“Surely not...?”</p><p>OldManGoryeo, who was now lying on the floor with dancing eyes, was one of the 399 survivors who had been summoned to the Busan Station concourse.</p><p>‘What a coincidence.’</p><p>Given that 399 isn't an especially small number, such a coincidence was certainly statistically possible. However, the real surprise lay in the fact that OldManGoryeo was not just familiar to me, but to all of you readers from a .</p><p>Our fiery SG-man, Seo Gyu, who was prettily decapitated by the Tutorial Fairy, remember?</p><p><em>"Hieeeeeek!"</em></p><p>There was someone who was drenched in Seo Gyu’s blood back then.</p><p><em>"P-people— People have died...! People have—! Aiiieee, he just died!"</em></p><p>Someone who, while running away, scattered Seo Gyu’s innards and blood across the Busan Station main concourse, causing a scene reminiscent of Moses parting the Red Sea (though with a bit more crimson).</p><p>That person was Sim Ah-ryeon.</p><p>‘...Why is she here?’</p><p>Isn’t the world unexpectedly small?</p><p>Footnotes:</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>***</p>
