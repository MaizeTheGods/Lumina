<p>Puppeteer III</p><p>As I mentioned earlier, I was neither a detective nor a cop. My deductions spanned both the past and the future.</p><p>That was why I could pull off such tricks.</p><p>“Puppeteer is my daughter.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Puppeteer. Ha-yul. Lee Ha-yul. She’s my daughter.”</p><p>19th cycle.</p><p>I deliberately followed the same steps as the previous cycle and came to Fukuoka.</p><p>Unless the butterfly effect intervened, the law of causality was strict. Jung Sang-guk, just as he did in the last cycle, said, “I’ll contact my daughter. Please wait at the lodging for a few days.”</p><p>The difference in the 19th cycle was that instead of eagerly heading to the lodging to enjoy the hot springs, this time, I secretly followed Jung Sang-guk.</p><p>A detective who catches only the crime without deducing the criminal’s past is third-rate. A detective who reveals the past events that led to the criminal’s wayward path is merely second-rate.</p><p>A true first-rate detective tracks the crime to unfold and witnesses all the causes in real-time.</p><p>Is that even a detective? If you’re upset about it, awaken the regression ability. The contract condition is that you must slay the Ten Legs and other monstrosities. It’s that simple, right?</p><p>Knock, knock.</p><p>Jung Sang-guk headed to the 'House of Dolls' as soon as the drinking party ended. After a few knocks, the housekeeper appeared.</p><p>So far, everything was normal.</p><p>The abnormality began immediately after.</p><p>“I’m back.”</p><p>Bowing, Jung Sang-guk lowered his head.</p><p>It was Jung Sang-guk, not the housekeeper, who bowed. Jung Sang-guk bowed to the housekeeper.</p><p>I couldn’t help but widen my eyes. Then, just as my mouth was about to drop open, the housekeeper spoke.</p><p>“Come in.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>The Prime Minister of the Second Provisional Government of Korea followed the housekeeper inside as if it were natural.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>“…….”</p><p>What on earth was going on?</p><p>Feeling as if I had seen a ghost, I clung close to the 'House of Dolls.'</p><p>Though my sight was blocked by the wall, my aura-enhanced hearing assisted my eavesdropping.</p><p>“How was the meeting?”</p><p>“Uneventful.”</p><p>“What’s Undertaker’s goal?”</p><p>“He wants to take Ms. Ha-yul to the academy.”</p><p>Murmur.</p><p>Their voices carried through the wall. Jung Sang-guk spoke with utmost respect but also with a hint of fear, while the housekeeper was cold and mechanical.</p><p>“Academy?”</p><p>That voice, precisely speaking, pronounced ‘a/ca/de/my’ in a segmented manner.</p><p>“Yes. He aims to gather and train talented awakeners like Ms. Ha-yul.”</p><p>“…….”</p><p>Ms. Ha-yul?</p><p>He called his own daughter 'Ms. Ha-yul'?</p><p>“I received the curriculum. Here. I read through it once, and it seems quite plausible. Sword Star is the principal, the Undertaker is the vice-principal, and Dang Seo-rin is an honorary professor…”</p><p>“So?”</p><p>“Excuse me?”</p><p>“Did you accept it?”</p><p>“No, no! How could I? I couldn’t make such a decision alone, so I arranged for him to stay at an inn in the city. He’ll stay put for about two days.”</p><p>Silence.</p><p>“He left during the meeting.”</p><p>“…Excuse me?”</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>“He went out during the drinking party. Alone with the Undertaker. What did you talk about?”</p><p>“Ah… Just stepped out for a smoke. Nothing much.”</p><p>“Liar.”</p><p>A chill ran down my spine.</p><p>‘How does she know that?’</p><p>There was definitely no one around when Jung Sang-guk and I talked alone. Could it be that someone from the provisional government at the party leaked information to the housekeeper?</p><p>Was this seemingly ordinary middle-aged housekeeper really the one pulling the strings behind the provisional government?</p><p>The questions didn’t last long. Soon, crucial testimony spilled from Jung Sang-guk’s mouth.</p><p>“Come down. Downstairs.”</p><p>At the command to come downstairs, Jung Sang-guk, who had maintained his composure, began to panic.</p><p>“Please, believe me! Ms. Ha-yul! Please, I beg you! Just spare the Doll Room!”</p><p>My jaw dropped.</p><p>“Lee Ha-yul!”</p><p>There was no mistake. Jung Sang-guk had addressed the housekeeper as 'Ms. Ha-yul.'</p><p>It made no sense unless Jung Sang-guk was senile and couldn’t tell his daughter’s face from the housekeeper’s.</p><p>There was no way the housekeeper and Lee Ha-yul were the same person. The housekeeper was in her 40s. In contrast, the corpse of Lee Ha-yul I saw in the previous cycle couldn’t have been older than her early 20s.</p><p>Thus.</p><p>‘Lee Ha-yul was controlling the housekeeper!’</p><p>Puppeteer.</p><p>Whoever gave her that name was spot on. I surmised that Lee Ha-yul had the ability to control people.</p><p>The housekeeper was a marionette. A puppet of Lee Ha-yul.</p><p>And not just the housekeeper.</p><p>I recalled the 'countless requests for handshakes' from the provisional government officials when I arrived in Fukuoka. The ministers of foreign affairs, finance, justice, and the interior. Their hugs felt strangely stiff.</p><p>‘Are the high-ranking officials of the provisional government marionettes too? All of them? Or only some? If only some, how far?’</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>In the 18th cycle, I had never imagined this truth, and it struck me like a shockwave.</p><p>In some sense, Old Man Scho was right.</p><p>“Come down. I’ve said it twice.”</p><p>“Please, please…”</p><p>The plea was cut off.</p><p>Jung Sang-guk could no longer articulate words. Only faint sounds like 'ugh- heok, guk-' could be heard.</p><p>The human ear was not so precise. Understanding everything by sound alone was difficult, but I could guess that Jung Sang-guk’s mouth was blocked by something.</p><p>“Hmmph…”</p><p>Jung Sang-guk struggled.</p><p>Given that an adult man couldn’t put up a proper fight, it was likely he was subdued by some abnormal means.</p><p>Cobwebs.</p><p>I recalled the cobwebs that had bound the housekeeper and Jung Sang-guk’s corpses. And the cobwebs that covered the House of Dolls.</p><p>Perhaps they weren’t cobwebs but 'puppet strings.'</p><p>“Hmmph…”</p><p>The sound of a body being dragged. The vibrations from the first floor gradually subsided.</p><p>I quickly understood the situation. Jung Sang-guk was being dragged to the basement by the housekeeper.</p><p>There was no more sound to be heard. The walls were too thick. My aura, accumulated over the 18 cycles, could only reach so far.</p><p>The basement. That must be the true lair of the Puppeteer.</p><p>Once again, my decision was swift.</p><p>I decided to break in.</p><p>An outstanding awakener has an exceptional memory. To survive the void, you must know how to remember various rules.</p><p>There is a proverb that is almost like common knowledge.</p><p>-A well-built awakener’s lair is comparable to the void.</p><p>Personally, I think it’s somewhat exaggerated, but it means to be cautious.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>For example, every train Dang Seo-rin used as her lair had a robust security system.</p><p>Unwelcome guests who entered without a 'train ticket' would learn how wonderful a killing machine a train could be.</p><p>This place was no different.</p><p>The 'House of Dolls' I visited in the last cycle was already an empty shell left after its owner died.</p><p>When I visited the first time, the Puppeteer must have deliberately lifted the security. They needed me to witness the housekeeper's death and return to the lodging.</p><p>-Click, click, click.</p><p>In other words, this was the first time I had set foot in the lair of the House of Dolls in its true sense.</p><p>The clicking noise echoed from all directions as soon as I burst through the door. The dolls were making the noise.</p><p>Entrance. Hallway. Ceiling.</p><p>Marionettes hung by puppet strings fiercely moved their jaws.</p><p>Along with the clicking of the jaws, the dolls’ joints creaked. Their blue, black, yellow, and red eyes rotated.</p><p>-Click, click, click, click.</p><p>A territorial marking. A signal to alert of an intruder.</p><p>And preprogrammed movements to eliminate impurities.</p><p>The marionettes’ movements were clearly meticulously calculated.</p><p>Their joints creaked like piano keys, the strings swayed, and a faint golden aura was present in the puppet strings.</p><p>‘Aura!’</p><p>At the time, the only ones who had mastered the use of aura were Old Man Scho and me. It was a specialty of the Freiheit Academy.</p><p>The puppet show unfolding before me was solely self-taught.</p><p>‘Not only can she control people, but she can also imbue the puppet strings with aura!’</p><p>I was impressed but didn’t hesitate.</p><p>Like the famous opening scene of the movie Cube, semi-transparent threads tightened from all directions. Any ordinary human would be dismembered just by touching them.</p><p>Fortunately or unfortunately, my life was far from ordinary.</p><p>I jumped in headfirst without using a sword, wrapping my entire body in aura.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>Swish—slash, slash, slash! The puppet strings, charging with killing intent, snapped as soon as they touched my body.</p><p>-Click, click, click, click.</p><p>The dolls moved even more frantically. The mass of cobwebs multiplied exponentially.</p><p>But it was useless.</p><p>Old Man Scho had evaluated me as ‘5th rate in martial talent, but top-class in aura talent.’ It was as if my external skills were compensated by internal energy.</p><p>And I had the [Resume] skill. A skill that carried over my physical abilities, including muscle strength and other body capabilities, into the next cycle.</p><p>That included the amount of aura.</p><p>In martial arts terms, by the 19th cycle, my internal energy had already surpassed a full 60 years.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>I reached out and crushed the head of a doll. The dolls swung up and down on the strings but couldn’t escape my grasp.</p><p>No matter how power-crazed the monstrosities of this world were, 60 years of cultivation was a lifetime achievement for a human.</p><p>I had spent that lifetime on the battlefield.</p><p>The awakeners entrenched in the relatively safe rear of Fukuoka couldn’t withstand my life.</p><p>-......!</p><p>The entrance was breached. The hallway and living room were successively neutralized. About 300 dolls crumbled in my hands.</p><p>Soon the murderous cobwebs also calmed down. The precise arrangement of the dolls must have been the core of this lair’s security system.</p><p>High-level awakening abilities. Excellent understanding of her powers. Prudence in not revealing her true form. Bold and decisive actions. Mastery of aura at a young age, learned independently. Precise calculation abilities.</p><p>...The test was over. Although I didn’t want to admit it, Old Man Scho’s intuition was correct.</p><p>A prodigy. The Puppeteer was certainly worth recruiting.</p><p>Even if she had no legs, that wasn’t a significant hindrance. She might not be able to fight on the front lines, but she had enormous potential as a support member.</p><p>“Lee Ha-yul. Are you listening?”</p><p>Silence.</p><p>“I am the Undertaker. Colleague of the Sword Star and the Great Witch. I apologize for barging in like this. It was my fault.”</p><p>Silence.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>“Lee Ha-yul. I want to talk to you. I used force to demonstrate my skills. I could break into the basement, but I don’t want our relationship to start off on the wrong foot.”</p><p>Silence.</p><p>“My goal is to persuade you to join the academy in Korea. Give me a chance to convince you.”</p><p>Creak.</p><p>The basement door opened.</p><p>“Come in.”</p><p>The housekeeper was holding the doorknob. Hearing her voice up close, the mechanical tone was even more apparent.</p><p>On reflection, the ideal form of machinery for humans had always been dolls, from paper and clockwork to AI chips.</p><p>Thus, the term mechanical sound could be corrected to doll sound without much error.</p><p>I passed the housekeeper and stepped into the basement. Thud. The heavy iron door closed behind me.</p><p>“…….”</p><p>Finally, I made eye contact with Lee Ha-yul herself.</p><p>This was the first time. In the previous cycle, her corpse had its eyes closed.</p><p>Golden eyes.</p><p>Light chestnut hair.</p><p>A legless girl.</p><p>Sometimes an awakener’s manifestation altered their hair and eye colors. The girl sitting in the wheelchair had a completely different hue from her father, Jung Sang-guk.</p><p>“Ugh! Hmmph, ugh…”</p><p>Jung Sang-guk, who had been dragged here earlier, was also in a wheelchair.</p><p>In terms of mobility issues, he was worse off than his daughter. Though he had legs, his entire body was bound tightly with puppet strings, like prey caught in a spider web.</p><p>Moreover, his fingernails were freshly dripping blood.</p><p>‘...Ah.’</p><p>Hmm.</p><p>That’s why Jung Sang-guk wore gloves in the 18th cycle.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>Footnotes:</p>
