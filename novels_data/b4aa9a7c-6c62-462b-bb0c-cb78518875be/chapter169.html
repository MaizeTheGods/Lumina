<p>The Traveler I</p><p>As you all know, whenever I, the Undertaker, felt stressed, I often took vacations. True to a regressor's style, my breaks were grand. I didn’t rest for just a week or two—I dedicated an entire cycle to a vacation. But what about other awakeners?</p><p>Of course, Sim Ah-ryeon, whose everyday life was practically a vacation, didn't need one, and Noh Do-hwa, whose mind was possessed by Zhuge Liang, didn’t even have the concept of rest.</p><p>But those two belonged to the realm of the ‘non-human.’ I was talking about humans.</p><p>Normal people needed rest.</p><p>Even Dang Seo-rin, who was very human compared to those two (having experienced corruption), was no exception.</p><p>“Hey, Undertaker? Want to go on a trip?”</p><p>One day, I returned to the hideout to find Dang Seo-rin casually sitting in my chair, eating potato chips.</p><p>If you faced such a situation, how would you react?</p><p>A. Trip? Out of the blue? Have you been drinking alone again?</p><p>B. Sorry, could you wait another thousand years?</p><p>Both answers were wrong.</p><p>I answered like this.</p><p>“A trip sounds good. Where do you want to go?”</p><p>Here’s a tip for dealing with people. If someone suddenly says they want to travel, just go along with it. Otherwise, your head might take a long trip.</p><p>“Heh? I didn’t expect you to agree right away. Aren’t you busy? Do you have time for a trip with me?”</p><p>“You’re just as busy. But I always make time for a trip, no matter how busy I am. It’s part of my busy life.”</p><p>“Hmm.” Guild leader Dang Seo-rin laughed, clearly pleased with my answer. I knew I wasn’t wrong. “Really? Then let’s really go on a trip.”</p><p>“Sure. Do you have a destination in mind?” I pressed her further.</p><p>“A destination… Hmm, not really. Just somewhere far. Not too close like Jeju Island.”</p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p>It felt like when a friend vaguely suggested eating out somewhere.</p><p>“I have some recommendations for you.”</p><p>But I was a regressor.</p><p>This wasn’t the first time Dang Seo-rin had suddenly wanted to travel, so I had prepared for almost every possibility.</p><p>I confidently handed her a travel guide. The neat cover and printing quality were good enough to be displayed in a bookstore.</p><p>“Huh? What’s this? &lt;Travel Guide for Samcheon Guild Leaders&gt;...?”</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>“It’s a travel guide I made just for you. The first chapter is Hawaii. It’s a perfect ‘resort void.’ Except for the high costs, it’s highly recommended.”</p><p>Though the constant Pearl Harbor attack reenactments and occasional SCP sightings were unique, Hawaii (Travel Difficulty: ★★★★) was rated well.</p><p>“Undertaker, you…”</p><p>Dang Seo-rin looked deeply touched by my insane preparedness.</p><p>I smiled inwardly. Success.</p><p>“Sounds good, but do you have any other options?”</p><p>Damn it. Normally, that would’ve been enough to settle for finding good restaurants.</p><p>But if it were that simple, this wouldn’t be an episode-worthy story.</p><p>“We see the sea every day here. I want something different. How about Paris?”</p><p>“Which Paris?”</p><p>“What do you mean, which Paris?”</p><p>Dang Seo-rin tilted her head.</p><p>“Paris, France. What else?”</p><p>“It’s layered with eras. There are six different Parises: during the Huguenot Wars, the French Revolution, World War II, and so on. Do you want to experience religious wars and witch trials? Then it’s the Huguenot Wars. Fancy seeing guillotines and Napoleon? Then it’s the Revolution. Choose your flavor of Paris romance.”</p><p>“Really, what is an anomaly…?”</p><p>“That reaction is the essence of an anomaly.”</p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p>She carefully examined the &lt;Travel Guide for Samcheon Guild Leaders&gt; I made.</p><p>“Ah. Let’s go here.”</p><p>She pointed decisively at a spot.</p><p>Uyuni Salt Flats (Travel Difficulty: ★★★★★★★☆).</p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p>Uyuni, where the desert flooded after rain, turning it into a horizon that mirrored the sky. The most brilliant ‘mirror’ on Earth.</p><p>It was located in Bolivia, South America.</p><p>Back in the day, the Inca Empire ruled the area, known for valuing heart beauty over facial beauty.</p><p>Anomalies warped space and time like taffy. Paris could simultaneously host witch trials and revolutions, while Uyuni could hold ‘Who has the prettiest heart?’ contests.</p><p>“……”</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>A bead of sweat formed in my mind.</p><p>Uyuni was already a challenging destination. In this post-apocalyptic world, its difficulty skyrocketed.</p><p>I scrutinized Dang Seo-rin’s expression, trying to gauge her mood like a North Korean citizen reading their leader’s face.</p><p>“Hmm? How about here? I’ve always wanted to visit.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>The leader was quite excited.</p><p>Faced with such a situation, how would you respond?</p><p>Swallowing my reluctance, I said without showing any displeasure, “Let’s go. The Uyuni Salt Flats. I’ve always wanted to visit.”</p><p>“Let’s leave tomorrow!”</p><p>“Are you serious…?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Tomorrow’s too soon. The day after tomorrow.”</p><p>“Okay!”</p><p>The next day, Dang Seo-rin hadn’t sobered up and resumed her guild duties. Instead, she was fully prepared. She had a red leather trunk and wore sunglasses.</p><p>Her airport fashion was perfect, with extra flair in her witch hat and robe.</p><p>I sighed inwardly.</p><p>“Whoever said regressors were omnipotent was wrong. I can’t even predict tomorrow’s fate…”</p><p>“What did you say?”</p><p>“Nothing. We’ll be gone for at least a week or two. Will the Samcheon Guild be okay?”</p><p>“Of course. I’ve been hinting for months that I wanted a break. They should be ready. If not, I’ll purge them. Are you okay?”</p><p>“I told you, it’s fine.”</p><p>Noh Do-hwa, managing the National Road Management Corps, would probably go berserk with anger when I returned, but she wouldn’t kill me.</p><p>Dang Seo-rin gave me sunglasses and giggled. “Are we taking your private plane? The, what was it? Red Dog?”</p><p>“Red Pig. Savoy S-21 modified. And no, it can’t fly to South America. Not enough fuel.”</p><p>“Then how?”</p><p>“I have a way. You’re lucky. Guides like me are rare nowadays.”</p><p>“Ooh. Confidence.”</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>We took the Inunaki Tunnel.</p><p>Knowing I was traveling, the tunnel seemed unusually welcoming.</p><p>→ Trap here →</p><p>(Caution) Ghost appears! Be careful!</p><p>Have a good trip. (Congrats)</p><p>These Japanese phrases were graffitied on the walls. Regular magical girl murals must have raised their favorability.</p><p>We arrived in Seoul via the high-speed path.</p><p>“Dang Seo-rin, do you know Korea’s first airport?”</p><p>“Huh? Gimpo Airport?”</p><p>“No, Yeouido Airport.”</p><p>There was once such an airport.</p><p>Yeouido was perfect for aircraft, as evident from Robot Taekwon V launching from the National Assembly.</p><p>It disappeared into history, overshadowed by Gimpo, but now it thrived as Korea’s only international airport.</p><p>Dang Seo-rin looked puzzled. “Was there always such a facility in Yeouido?”</p><p>“No. The 'Comprehensive Income Tax Anomaly' appears every May. When taxes accumulate past a certain point, the 'Yeouido Airport' void forms.”</p><p>“Ugh. Are we building an airport with our taxes? An anomaly?”</p><p>“Yes. They take their government role seriously, using taxes properly. They’re anomalies, but effective.”</p><p>“Really, what is an anomaly…?”</p><p>As usual, I skipped the reactions.</p><p>Dang Seo-rin tugged my sleeve.</p><p>“Hey, Undertaker.”</p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p>“The airport windows are all red? Hundreds of red handprints? Am I seeing things?”</p><p>“Don’t worry. It’s the interior design.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>Modern architecture favored void style. Red-stained windows were just cute details.</p><p>Yeouido Airport originally operated before overseas travel was common. Back then, traveling abroad was a luxury for a select few. Naturally, the officials at the immigration desk were stern.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>- Where are you from?</p><p>An anomaly officer mumbled, mimicking human speech.</p><p>The desire to teach SCVs trying to flee was palpable.</p><p>His acting was impressive. If his eyes weren’t fingers, I might’ve believed him.</p><p>“Here’s my ID.”</p><p>I handed over my ID. I’d farmed it at Namsan the day before. It took two days to prepare.</p><p>- Ah. You’re from the Special Forces.</p><p>The anomaly’s tone became respectful.</p><p>- We received notice yesterday. But who’s the person with you…?</p><p>I feigned annoyance. “Do I need to explain everything?”</p><p>- No, of course not. My apologies. Proceed, agent.</p><p>The airport swarmed with anomalies, but we walked to the boarding gate easily.</p><p>“This isn’t the overseas trip I imagined…” Dang Seo-rin murmured.</p><p>“For South America, this is the easiest way.”</p><p>Ignoring the 60% crash rate, it was a good mode of travel.</p><p>As we walked to the gate, I explained, “We’ll go to Spain first. From there, it’s easier to travel to South America and gain bonuses related to Inca anomalies. The flight is longer but safer—”</p><p>When we finally boarded, I stopped talking. Dang Seo-rin, who was following me, also halted.</p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p>“Uh.”</p><p>The old plane already had 212 passengers, paired off.</p><p>And all 212 had our faces.</p><p>Dressed as if they were also traveling.</p><p>They stared at us, and we stared back. A total of 107 Undertakers and 107 Dang Seo-rins in silence.</p><p>“…….”</p><p>“…Is this part of the interior, Undertaker?”</p><p>Hmm.</p><p>This was unexpected.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>Footnotes:</p>
