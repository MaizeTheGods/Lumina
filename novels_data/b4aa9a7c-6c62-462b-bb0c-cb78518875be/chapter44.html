<p>Observer III</p><p>There was a hypothesis I had long suspected.</p><p>――Perhaps certain monsters, certain grotesqueries, were actually born from humans?</p><p>It wasn't a thought I had always held.</p><p>The point at which I began to seriously consider this hypothesis was when I unraveled the identity of Udumbara.</p><p>As you know, the Udumbara germinated in Asan, South Chungcheong Province. The bodies of a mother and child, presumed to have starved to death. It was a human that had given birth to a virus of unprecedented scale.</p><p>Logically, it didn’t make sense that a grotesquery could be born from the body of an ordinary human. However, with a slight change in perspective, it was entirely plausible.</p><p>If we assume that the mother or child had 'that ability,' everything was clarified.</p><p>Which of the mother or child was the Awakener, I couldn't tell, as they had already starved to death by the time we found them. But if either or both were Awakeners?</p><p>If the Udumbara itself was a type of ability?</p><p>――If an Awakener's ability is, in fact, no different from the abilities of monsters and grotesqueries when objectively considered.</p><p>In theory, all Awakeners could potentially degenerate into grotesqueries. No, it could not even be called degeneration. From the start, Awakeners and grotesqueries were fundamentally the same.</p><p>[The ability to continuously regenerate tentacles and grow two hearts within one’s body].</p><p>Thus were born the Ten Legs.</p><p>[The ability to freely observe a vast area as large as the Korean Peninsula and telepathically communicate with all Awakeners].</p><p>Thus claimed herself the Saintess.</p><p>If viewed from the perspective of someone entirely unrelated to humanity, say, an alien, which of the two would be considered the more dangerous creature?</p><p>Whether they took on 'human form' or not was merely a superficial difference, both were terrifying beings in essence.</p><p>“...Saintess.”</p><p>“Yes, I killed them.”</p><p>An unexpectedly refreshing affirmation.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>But considering it came from the Saintess, it was more chilling than refreshing.</p><p>“Why…….”</p><p>“Mr. Undertaker. That's a strange question. I have always maintained the same stance.”</p><p>The Saintess remained expressionless.</p><p>“To prevent Awakeners from committing crimes rashly, I created the constellations that don’t even exist in this world. I simulated them. The operating principle of the constellation system is the possibility that [someone might be watching every move I make]. Anxiety. Humans restrain themselves when observed by others, and let go of their reason when they are not.”</p><p>The Saintess tilted her head.</p><p>“Isn't a serial killer no different?”</p><p>“…….”</p><p>“The constellation system was able to control the rampages of the Awakeners. However, it couldn't reach ordinary people, civilians. Sadly, my telepathy only works with Awakeners. So, I simply created another possibility for civilians to fear.”</p><p>Snow was falling.</p><p>Flakes of snow landed on the Saintess's head and double coat, melting as soon as they touched her.</p><p>The Saintess's eyes narrowed.</p><p>“There are too many pieces of trash in this world. No, that's not quite the right word. There are far too many beasts masquerading as humans.”</p><p>“So…….”</p><p>“So, I killed them. Are you worried there might have been innocent people? You don't have to worry about that, Mr. Undertaker. I checked several times. I have never once regretted my killings.”</p><p>Why?</p><p>Despite clearly having a conversation with the Saintess, the presence of the person before me felt unfamiliar. It wasn’t just that she seemed like a different person or had a changed personality.</p><p>Her very existence had changed.</p><p>Unexplainable sweat formed on the palm of my right hand.</p><p>“Mr. Undertaker, you are too kind.”</p><p>“...Me? I didn’t expect to hear that from you, Saintess.”</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>“You always give everyone infinite chances.”</p><p>Crunch.</p><p>The Saintess took a step forward. The snow beneath her feet crunched. I reflexively stepped back, maintaining a distance from the Saintess.</p><p>Even if the Saintess was a murderer, I had no reason to flee from her. We were bound by blood. Even if she were to burn the whole world down, I would stand by her side.</p><p>Therefore, the reason I moved wasn’t logical but instinctual.</p><p>“Infinite chances?”</p><p>“Yes. Mr. Undertaker, what do you think about your [regression] ability? Surely, you must believe that you are constantly receiving chances. But from my point of view, observing you from the sidelines, my opinion differs.”</p><p>“Which is?”</p><p>“It's not just you receiving chances. Every time the world regresses, everyone else gets a chance too.”</p><p>One step.</p><p>“In the last cycle, a villain who killed an innocent girl received a chance to change this time around. The evil one who took the last bit of food from a child, tying up the child and watching them starve to death, also had the opportunity to make a different choice. Once. Twice. Ten times. Twenty times. Thirty times. Forty times. Fifty times.”</p><p>“…….”</p><p>“But how many really hesitated before their wicked deeds? How many have killed and tortured the same person over and over again, forty, fifty times?”</p><p>“...Those people do not know that the world is regressing.”</p><p>“That’s right. Ignorance. Not knowing is always a good excuse. Even when it comes to killing people, they always hide behind ignorance. I understand. I will understand. But what about the people who were killed?”</p><p>“…….”</p><p>“Why must they endure countless wrongful deaths and wrongful suffering?”</p><p>One step.</p><p>“Someday, Mr. Undertaker, you will succeed in saving the world. Yes, definitely. In that future world, even the villains will be granted the chance to live a new life. Perhaps in a more relaxed, more peaceful era, they might not feel the need to commit crimes. I think, that is very… wrong.”</p><p>Another step.</p><p>“Mr. Undertaker. If someone kills, they should be punished.”</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>The Saintess spoke quietly.</p><p>“They shouldn't just get another chance.”</p><p>From some point on.</p><p>Without me noticing, a small, sleek hand axe had appeared in the Saintess's grasp. That she had armed herself at a speed beyond my perception indicated this.</p><p>Sweat dripped more freely from my neck.</p><p>“No matter how many times you regress, Mr. Undertaker, and no matter how much you strive to save this world, the sins committed by the villains will not disappear. No. I will make sure they don’t disappear.”</p><p>“What do you mean……?”</p><p>“I will eternally inflict pain on the sinners.”</p><p>Vapor rose from the Saintess’s mouth.</p><p>It was a white smoke rising towards the endless sky.</p><p>“Feel free to regress anytime, Mr. Undertaker. A hundred times. Two hundred times. A thousand times if you must, to save this world, but I will not leave the benefit of your efforts for the villains to enjoy.”</p><p>“…….”</p><p>“Each time you regress, I will execute the punishment that should rightly descend on this world. If the villains continue to commit crimes forever, I will forever torture them.”</p><p>The vapor twisted from the Saintess’s mouth.</p><p>It was her sneer.</p><p>“Although I may be powerless to create a paradise in this world, I have enough ability to create a small hell.”</p><p>When the Saintess took that final step, I drew my sword like a flash of lightning.</p><p>The target was the hand axe in the Saintess’s hand.</p><p>Why the Saintess had drawn her weapon against me, I could not tell, but I had no doubts about her intellectual abilities. If the Saintess had drawn a weapon, there must have been a reason for it.</p><p>What was the Saintess’s plan? To subdue me, a regressor, and then what did she intend to do?</p><p>It was hard to guess, but certainly, it would not end well for me.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>I suppressed an ominous feeling and attacked the Saintess.</p><p>“What……?”</p><p>However, the Saintess easily dodged my sword energy. Just one step to the side.</p><p>A simple movement as if she had known from the start where the attack would come from and where it would go.</p><p>Clang—!</p><p>Suddenly, a sound like glass breaking rang out from my body. It wasn’t from one place alone. Left arm, right arm, left leg, right leg, my limbs vibrated as auras collided.</p><p>Four hand axes had struck my body and rebounded in all directions.</p><p>I couldn’t tell when or from where the hand axes had flown at me.</p><p>It was as if they had suddenly appeared ‘right in front of me.’</p><p>“Keuk?”</p><p>If I hadn’t developed a habit of wrapping my body in aura like armor, the blow just now would have caused serious injuries to my limbs.</p><p>I immediately widened the distance from the Saintess. I kicked the snow-covered ground and jumped far back.</p><p>But the gap did not widen.</p><p>“You’re strong. As expected, Mr. Undertaker.”</p><p>Despite having jumped tens of meters at once, the Saintess was already standing before me.</p><p>“……!”</p><p>Not only that. Clang, the hand axes rebounded off my body. This time there were six. I could only react and knock two away with my sword.</p><p>‘How? Even if she had a talent for martial arts, this was too much. This couldn’t be an ability unless……’</p><p>It was then.</p><p>Seeing the Saintess easily following my movements, a memory from long ago surfaced.</p><p>36th cycle. The first conversation I had with the Saintess.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>-How did you create the cConstellations?</p><p>-Thanks to my ability. I can use [Clairvoyance] and [Telepathy].</p><p>-But just with Clairvoyance and Telepathy, it’s impossible to perform the constellations, right? You need to observe multiple people simultaneously and send messages. Don’t you have another ability?</p><p>-Ah, that’s...</p><p>At that time, the Saintess had smiled faintly.</p><p>-That, is a secret. I’ll tell you later.</p><p>An old memory.</p><p>Now, I seemed to know what that secret was.</p><p>“Time stop……?”</p><p>“…….”</p><p>The Saintess hesitated.</p><p>“Did you know?”</p><p>“I only guessed. It was one of several possibilities. To perform multiple constellations and observe multiple Awakeners simultaneously, anyway, a tremendous ability would be necessary. Like multiple perspectives or multiple personalities……. But time stop.”</p><p>Time stop. The least likely joker card I had thought of.</p><p>If it was true that she possessed even the [Time Stop] ability, then the Saintess was essentially the most powerful Awakener.</p><p>I forgot even the predicament I was in and let out a hollow laugh.</p><p>“Clairvoyance, Telepathy, and now Time Stop? That’s unbelievable. Even one would be enough to be called a top-tier ability, and you monopolize three. Please stop cheating, Saintess.”</p><p>“You flatter me too much. No matter how much I advance, I’m nothing compared to an infinite regressor.”</p><p>...At last, everything made sense.</p><p>The Saintess had been using [Time Stop] to simultaneously observe so many Awakeners and perform the constellations.</p><p>Avoiding my attack and suddenly throwing hand axes from four directions was understandable.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>After all, if she had stopped time, she could calmly assess from which direction the attack was coming and where she needed to attack.</p><p>Was that all? If she used [Clairvoyance] on me, the Saintess could synchronize her vision with mine, immediately knowing which direction I was looking at and aiming for.</p><p>If she was cautious, she could be called practically invincible.</p><p>“From the beginning, my ability wasn’t this strong. When I stopped time initially, only my consciousness flowed or at best, my eyes could move, but as time passed, it grew stronger. Now, I can stop time and travel across the country to find villains.”</p><p>“Amazing. So, what do you intend to do by overpowering me?”</p><p>“Well.”</p><p>The world momentarily stopped.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, I could only widen my eyes.</p><p>What had been barely three or four footsteps in the snowy ground had suddenly blossomed with countless footsteps. There were no footsteps of mine. Only the footprints of the shoes worn by the Saintess surrounded me by hundreds, thousands, as if displayed in a kaleidoscope.</p><p>This meant that my moment was her eternity.</p><p>The Saintess did not waste her time.</p><p>Now, thousands of bullets flying towards me from all directions proved her diligence.</p><p>Why just bullets? Among them were dozens of hand axes, each meticulously infused with aura.</p><p>[It’s a secret.]</p><p>Countless bullets surged towards me.</p><p>Boss battle.</p><p>Ocean-class threat level.</p><p>Awakener. Alias, Saintess.</p><p>Corruptor. Alias, Executioner.</p><p>The battle begins.</p><p>Footnotes:</p>
