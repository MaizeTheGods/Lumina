<p>Promoted ⅠI</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Your Excellency. Upon reflection, I realize I haven’t truly enjoyed my life.”</p><p>Yu Ji-won said.</p><p>“Even if I were to be Time Sealed and relive my 'happiest day,' I doubt that happiness would hold much objective value.”</p><p>Huh… What is she talking about?</p><p>“While other ordinary people spend their sealed time happily with their families or lovers, I would be endlessly repeating the day I got accepted into university or the day I topped my class. Imagine that, Your Excellency. Is that truly the most valuable form of happiness? I find it extremely unfair.”</p><p>“No… what… So what is it you want to say to me?”</p><p>“Honorable vice guild leader, please, in the next cycle, inform me in advance that you are a Regressor and the Prophet who promises the gospel of eternal days. If I know that, this wretched sheep will tirelessly work to create the happiest day I can, to prepare for the heaven I will eventually enjoy.”</p><p>“...…”</p><p>Silence filled the tent.</p><p>“So, if I understand correctly, I will Time Seal you, but before that, you want to create a day you will happily repeat forever?”</p><p>“As expected, Your Excellency. Your understanding is astute.”</p><p>“Are you truly insane?”</p><p>"Vice guild leader! I will serve you faithfully until the day this world ends. So please, promise me this.”</p><p>“The world has nearly ended! No, Ji-won. I’m sorry. This vice guild leader was wrong. I was lying. It’s unreasonable to think someone like a Regressor exists, right?”</p><p>“I have always trusted you, vice guild leader. Isn’t our bond of friendship not so trivial? Of course, in the next cycle, I might be too foolish to recognize you as the Savior. Then just tell me, ‘I know you killed someone when you were fifteen and dumped the body in a celery field in North Korea.’”</p><p>“What? You killed someone in middle school? No, wait… Hey! Stop grabbing my pants! Let go! Hey, let go! Lieutenant Yu! You crazy bitch!”</p><p>Having lived as a regressor, I had encountered many lunatics, but Yu Ji-won was the first psychopath who actively sought to exploit my regression solely for her own pleasure and happiness.</p><p>Even upon reflection after 1183 cycles, there was no one like Yu Ji-won.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>The most astonishing fact was… this girl wasn’t just talking; she truly served me with utmost loyalty until her dying breath.</p><p>-̷̱̀G̶͇̚r̶̫̄ṵ̷̈́a̷͍͑ȯ̷̜o̸͈͗r̴͑r̵͉͐ä̶͚́r̵̠͌ṛ̶̎r̴̹̈́r̴͎̍!</p><p>In the fifth cycle, I lost my head within two minutes of engaging the Ten Legs.</p><p>But in that battle, many awakeners died before me, including Yu Ji-won.</p><p>"Vice guild leader! Danger!”</p><p>Yu Ji-won even shielded me from the Ten Legs’ tentacles. She leaped in front of me and took the hit herself.</p><p>I was dumbfounded.</p><p>Because even without her intervention, I could have dodged that attack.</p><p>If there were an award for ‘The Most Pointless Death of the Year,’ this would be a prime contender.</p><p>If the person who died wasn’t my direct subordinate, who had been through thick and thin with me, I might have clapped and laughed.</p><p>“Hey… Lieutenant Yu, no, Ji-won… what the hell is this new insanity…?”</p><p>“Cough.”</p><p>Yu Ji-won, with a neat hole in her chest, coughed up blood.</p><p>Her blue eyes, shining with a seriousness this world would never see again, looked up at me.</p><p>“Next cycle… Your Excellency, promise…”</p><p>Thud.</p><p>And she died.</p><p>“...…”</p><p>This is driving me crazy.</p><p>It was absurd, but I wasn’t cruel enough to ignore the last words of someone who died in my place (even a pointless death is still a kind of death, right?).</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>I regretted not being a bit more cruel, but it was too late. I delivered the message to Yu Ji-won in the next cycle.</p><p>“Indeed.”</p><p>The silver-haired cool chick nodded.</p><p>Since the world hadn’t completely collapsed yet, resources were still plentiful. Yu Ji-won raided a convenience store with an axe and fortified it.</p><p>She claimed she had owned the convenience store for a long time, but I didn’t believe her. This girl could lie more naturally than she breathed.</p><p>“I understand that you claim to be a regressor. I also understand that you possess the ability known as the Time Seal. But all of this is just unverified claims, isn’t it?”</p><p>“I also know you’re a psychopath.”</p><p>“That’s not surprising. Everyone around me has known that for a long time.”</p><p>-Kyaaaah!</p><p>In the middle of our conversation, a creature crashed through the convenience store window. It looked like a cockroach monster. I charged my staff with aura and pierced its mouth beautifully.</p><p>Crash! Yu Ji-won approached and finished it off with an axe to the head. The creature trembled.</p><p>Yu Ji-won always had a keen sense for combat. This talent was evident even back then.</p><p>We resumed our conversation as if nothing had happened.</p><p>“What more proof do you need? I know you like Three Kingdoms and that you majored in Latin.”</p><p>“What? Hmm. I see. Very interesting, but it’s still just unverified claims.”</p><p>“Damn it, I know you killed someone when you were fifteen and dumped the body in a celery field in North Korea. Believe me, you psycho bitch!”</p><p>“…Oh.”</p><p>Yu Ji-won blinked her eyebrows.</p><p>“I understand. Your statement just now greatly increases the credibility of your claims.”</p><p>“Why? Because it’s a truth no one else knows?”</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>“To be precise, because it’s ‘incorrect knowledge.’ It wasn’t when I was fifteen; it was when I was fourteen. And it wasn’t in North Korea; it was in Dobong Mountain.”</p><p>“...…”</p><p>“If your ability was to read minds or uncover secrets, there would be no reason to accept incorrect information. Therefore, you must have received this wrong information from someone else. And I have several reasons to be confident that my murder was never discovered.”</p><p>“...…”</p><p>“Hmmm, regression. And past cycles of me sending letters to myself through a regressor as a courier… very interesting. Few people in life experience something this extraordinary.”</p><p>This is driving me crazy, seriously.</p><p>I opened a can of coffee from the convenience store shelf and chugged it. Yu Ji-won didn’t stop me.</p><p>“Consider this can of coffee my courier fee. I’ve delivered the last words, so I’m leaving now.”</p><p>“Ah. Please wait for two minutes. I will come with you.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>I was startled.</p><p>When I turned around, Yu Ji-won was rolling up the national and city maps spread on the counter and stuffing them into a trunk.</p><p>Incidentally, the most striking interior decoration in this convenience store was the ‘Tutorial Fairy’s’ skin. I did not misspeak. This girl had skinned the fairy and mounted it on the wall like a trophy.</p><p>I could confidently say she had skinned at least two different beings before.</p><p>“Hey, what do you mean, come with me? You have plenty of supplies here. Just hold out here.”</p><p>“That’s the worst plan.”</p><p>Yu Ji-won pushed up her glasses.</p><p>“In the previous cycle, didn’t I eventually leave here and join your guild? If I’m going to leave anyway, it’s better to join now and rise through the ranks faster.”</p><p>“It’s not my guild, it’s led by Dang Seo-rin.”</p><p>“Ah. I see. I apologize. Please guide and correct me whenever I make mistakes in the future.”</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>“No, no need for corrections or guidance, just don’t follow me, okay? Hey. Hey! I don’t want this! I don’t like you anymore! Go away, will you?”</p><p>Yu Ji-won did not go away.</p><p>She clung to me like a parasite. This psychopath’s chosen host was the Samcheon World.</p><p>Yu Ji-won demonstrated her dedication to the witch cosplay in the guild by proving she possessed not only the ‘Minimap’ skill but also ‘Dang Seo-rin Favorability.’</p><p>“Wow, vice guild leader. Where did you find such a cute kid?”</p><p>“It’s the honor of three lifetimes, Great Witch.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>Yu Ji-won, selected as an early member of Samcheon World, was promoted faster and higher than her 5th cycle self. One could say she made quite a spectacle.</p><p>Her official title was Operations Manager, serving as my deputy and special secretary to the guild leader, Dang Seo-rin. In short, she firmly established herself as the third-ranking member within the guild.</p><p>Considering she was the third in command of Korea’s top guild, it was equivalent to being the third-ranking executive in the largest corporation before the apocalypse. She could be considered highly successful.</p><p>However, our silver-haired psychopath Yu Ji-won was not the type to care about others' evaluations.</p><p>“Manager Yu.”</p><p>“Yes, vice guild leader.”</p><p>“…We’ll be fighting the Ten Legs soon. Shouldn’t we have your funeral first?”</p><p>“Ah.”</p><p>“Anyway, from what I see, you seem much happier in this cycle than in the last one. While I can’t know what you consider happiness, wouldn’t you be satisfied with the afterlife you’ll have now?”</p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p>She said, “Hmm.” This girl.</p><p>This psychopath just looked around the air and said, “Hmm.”</p><p>Visually, her lips formed an exact 'ω'.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>"Vice guild leader, I suddenly thought. If I’m happier in this 6th cycle than I was in the 5th… there’s a good chance I’ll be a bit happier in the 7th, isn’t there?”</p><p>“Ji-won. What are you talking about, Ji-won…”</p><p>“Please, in the next cycle, try your best to make me happier before my funeral…”</p><p>“Hey!”</p><p>By now, you can probably guess how this story ended.</p><p>That’s right. Without needing any epilogue, to cut straight to the conclusion, Yu Ji-won, this damn bitch, used me as a delivery girl for her last words every single time.</p><p>From the 6th cycle to the 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th.</p><p>Every time I asked if she was finally happy enough for a funeral, she would say,</p><p>“Hmm. In the next cycle, I think I’ll be a bit happier.”</p><p>She kept postponing her sealing endlessly.</p><p>Seriously, who does that?</p><p>I’ve read countless web novels and encountered numerous regressor protagonists after the 550th cycle, but I’ve never seen a character who uses an infinite regressor like this.</p><p>Even later on… she joined the National Road Management Corps under Noh Do-hwa.</p><p>“This Minimap skill is perfect for our Corps. Thanks to it, tracking the members’ locations in real-time is effortless. Wow. Thanks for introducing such a talented individual for free, Awakener Undertaker…”</p><p>“...…”</p><p>And after several cycles, Yu Ji-won smoothly rose to the position of Operations Control Room Chief, just below Noh Do-hwa in the National Road Management Corps.</p><p>So, over a very long period, spanning hundreds of years, Yu Ji-won was genuinely ‘climbing the ranks.’</p><p>From a regular guild member to my deputy. From my deputy to the third-ranking member of Samcheon World. From a Samcheon World executive to a key figure in the National Road Management Corps.</p><p>It was a miracle of creating something from nothing! A living success story!</p><p>I couldn’t fathom how such a phenomenon could occur.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>A power-hungry monster climbing ranks every cycle? Isn’t that a real anomaly?</p><p>More astonishing was that this ambitious monster never once betrayed me in the long history spanning 1183 cycles.</p><p>Once, I asked her over drinks why she never betrayed me, and her answer was astonishing.</p><p>“Betray you, Undertaker? I would rather die than do that.”</p><p>“Why? You’re a psychopath.”</p><p>“Please stop stereotyping psychopaths. You’re a regressor with Complete Memory. You remember everyone’s every action and judge them accordingly. So, I must always be cautious not to displease you. Isn’t that common sense?”</p><p>Holding a clear soju glass, Yu Ji-won looked up at the full moon in the night sky. Her gaze was wistful.</p><p>“I find it hard to understand how someone could be foolish enough to betray you. On the other hand, it’s truly fascinating. Why are so many people so foolish?”</p><p>“……”</p><p>I really don’t understand this girl…</p><p>But on the flip side, no one knew Yu Ji-won as deeply as I did. By the 50th cycle, I was certain of one thing about her.</p><p>Even if everyone else wanted to be Time Sealed, Yu Ji-won definitely wouldn’t.</p><p>I once thought she was born in the wrong era.</p><p>But I was wrong. This girl would thrive in any era. Even in an apocalypse where civilization had crumbled, she remained the ultimate survivor. In fact, she was optimized for this era.</p><p>At this point, I felt half-obligated, half-jokingly to ask Yu Ji-won.</p><p>“Ji-won.”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“Are you happy now?”</p><p>The chess piece on the map toppled over with a plop.</p><p>Then my silver-haired deputy, the nearly one-of-a-kind Three Kingdoms club member and the original member of my regression life, the psychopath friend would ponder for a moment, resting her chin on her hand, before giving her answer.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>“I think I can be a bit happier next time.”</p><p>Footnotes:</p>
