<p>Genealogy ⅠI</p><p>Noh Do-hwa's ominous muttering had no effect on our safari adventure.</p><p>Even Sim Ah-ryeon and Seo Gyu, who were not easily excited, were noisily chatting in the back seat. It must have helped that I had prepared factory-made potato chips and chocolate snacks for this day.</p><p>“This is my first time being invited somewhere and playing with others...”</p><p>“This is also the first time my hyung has invited me somewhere, so I’m really looking forward to it.”</p><p>“As expected of the Busan Station fam... The bond is incomparable to other losers...!”</p><p>I smiled contentedly and turned the steering wheel. Today, I, the Undertaker, was guiding them not as a guild leader but as a humble guide.</p><p>“From here, it is the entrance to Idea Ranch. Welcome, everyone.”</p><p>“Wow! Ah? Ahhh...?”</p><p>Sim Ah-ryeon's cheer, as she looked at the ranch through the window, peaked like a soprano and gradually descended.</p><p>“Uh... Guild leader...?”</p><p>“What’s the matter?”</p><p>“Why does the horse ranch have... um, a ten-meter-high barbed wire fence and concrete walls?”</p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>“Certainly, it’s not a very visually appealing outdoor decoration.”</p><p>“Yes, yes. It's a bit scary, or to be more honest, it’s almost hideous...”</p><p>“I agree.”</p><p>I pressed the remote control button.</p><p>With a rumbling sound, the heavy gate sealing the safari theme park slowly opened.</p><p>“But Ah-ryeon, the appearance of something is just a secondary attribute, not its essence.”</p><p>“Y-Yes...?”</p><p>“Think about it. Ranches naturally have fences. It’s only natural because the animals should not escape. Our Idea Ranch has just made the fence a little more sturdy. The essence of the ranch hasn’t changed at all. Understand?”</p><p>“Eh...”</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>The tires of my safari truck rolled gracefully through the open gate.</p><p>“By the way, it’s fine to keep the windows open, but don’t stick your head out. It could be dangerous while driving.”</p><p>“Ah, yes. Yes...”</p><p>As soon as Sim Ah-ryeon pulled her upper body back inside the car, I pressed the remote control button again.</p><p>With a clattering sound, metal bars rose from the window frames, protecting the windows. “Hic,” Sim Ah-ryeon flinched.</p><p>“Guild leader? The iron bars on the windows, why did they suddenly...?”</p><p>“Well, I made some modifications to the truck for the safari. How is it? Isn’t it awesome? Your guild leader has many talents.”</p><p>“It’s amazing, really. But, why is such amazingness necessary...?”</p><p>“......”</p><p>By this point, Seo Gyu also fell silent like Noh Do-hwa. Looking through the rearview mirror, I saw that his manly face was starting to sweat.</p><p>“Of course, it's to thoroughly ensure the safety of our precious tourists, isn’t it?”</p><p>“No, what I mean is, why is safety necessary for just a casual look around the ranch...”</p><p>“Ah-ryeon.”</p><p>Seo Gyu spoke solemnly.</p><p>“Y-yes?”</p><p>“Put on your seatbelt.”</p><p>“Ugh. I hate wearing a seatbelt because it’s uncomfortable and makes me feel suffocated...”</p><p>Then it happened.</p><p><em>Heeeeyaaa!</em></p><p>“Eeeeek?”</p><p>Simultaneously with the cute neigh from outside the car, Sim Ah-ryeon screamed inside.</p><p>“Ah. Everyone, please turn your gaze to the 2 o’clock direction. Can you see? This is our proud first horse from Idea Ranch, Kkingkki.”</p><p>“A horse...?”</p><p>Noh Do-hwa looked out through the metal bars with cold eyes.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>“Is that a horse...?”</p><p>The horse was warily eyeing our safari truck.</p><p>A sign that originally read ‘Kkingkki’ was hung around its neck, but it had broken it again, so only ‘Kki■ki’ was legible. Really, it was quite a troublemaker.</p><p>Of course, having been raised in the void, it looked somewhat different from an ordinary horse. That is, its appearance, a secondary attribute, not an essential quality, showed a slight difference.</p><p>For example, unlike other horses, Kkingkki could walk on two legs. Not like a human's upright posture, but hunched over.</p><p>Anyway, it was still a horse.</p><p>Its skin color was not brown, black, or white, but a somewhat greenish hue, likely an adaptation to the weed-filled plains of Daesan-myeon.</p><p>And... well, its teeth were sharp. But horses originally have well-developed teeth. Kkingkki had simply undergone a bit of convergent evolution.</p><p>Anyway, it was still a horse.</p><p>Finally, its hooves, in other words, its nails and claws, had also become slightly sharper. But considering that hooves are originally part of a horse’s body, this was a minor change.</p><p>After surveying all these attributes, Noh Do-hwa muttered bleakly.</p><p>“That’s... a dinosaur...”</p><p>At that moment, Kkingkki opened its mouth.</p><p><em>Heeeeyaaa!</em></p><p>Well. From the bond I built over the past six months with the horses, I interpreted it as “What nonsense are you talking about, Do-hwa? I’m a horse.”</p><p>“Huh? A dinosaur? Oh, don’t slander us. How do our kids look like dinosaurs? Dinosaurs are hideous creatures covered in fuzz, whereas our kids have smooth skin.”</p><p>“Hmm. Leaving aside the fact that horses grow manes, since when did horse skin boast a smooth green color like a reptile...?”</p><p>“Velociraptor?”</p><p>Seo Gyu shouted from the back seat.</p><p>“Raptor! It's a raptor, hyung!”</p><p>“Raptor?”</p><p>“Yes! From Jurassic Park. Wait. Oh my god, don’t tell me you haven’t seen Jurassic Park either?”</p><p>“Of course not. That movie came out before I was born.”</p><p>“No, that’s the old trilogy. My god. Hyung, how can you be such a movie ignoramus? There are so many recent series...”</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>“Eeeeek!”</p><p>Noh Do-hwa was horrified, Seo Gyu was excited, and Sim Ah-ryeon was thrilled. Clearly, everyone was delighted by Kkingkki’s cuteness.</p><p>I continued driving the safari truck.</p><p>“Ah. Ah. Now please turn your gaze to the 9 o’clock direction. There you can see Byojoki, the thirty-third successful gene work horse of our ranch. It walks on all fours, as a horse should.”</p><p>“Triceratops!”</p><p>“Please don’t call our Byojoki by such a crude name, Seo Gyu.”</p><p>“Another dinosaur... What did you do to these horses to make them grow rhino horns on their heads...?”</p><p>“Now, look at the 11 o’clock direction. That’s Kongkongi. A horse with a very pretty head.”</p><p>“Pachycephalosaurus! Head-butting dinosaur!”</p><p>“Oh, Kongkongi seems happy to see us. He’s knocking on the truck. Ha ha. Let’s all wave and greet Kongkongi!”</p><p>“Heeeek... The car is shaking...”</p><p>As expected, the safari tour was a great success.</p><p>Every time I introduced a member of our ranch, cheers erupted.</p><p>Throughout my entire regressor life, there hadn’t been a day as rewarding as this one as a host.</p><p>“Alright. Now, everyone, isn’t it a bit boring to just watch the horses through the iron bars from the safely protected truck?”</p><p>“No!”</p><p>“I feel the same as you! So, I will specially allow you to interact with the horses under my guidance.”</p><p>“Ahhh! Ahhh...!”</p><p>Sim Ah-ryeon wailed. Really, she didn’t have to be so overjoyed.</p><p>“In that sense, I will now introduce my top pick, the pride of Idea Ranch, Keongkeongi.”</p><p>“Keongkeongi...?”</p><p>“A very gentle and good-natured fellow. Everyone, please get off the truck. Ah-ryeon? Come out nicely. If you don’t, I’ll expose you as OldManGoryeo on SG Net.”</p><p>“Hick. Hic, hic...”</p><p>Following me, everyone got off the safari truck.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>“Keongkeongi! Come here!”</p><p>With a whistle, I took a goat barbecue from the trunk and threw it into the distant forest.</p><p>A moment later.</p><p>With a thud, a goat’s hind leg flew out of the forest, torn off. Coincidentally, the hind leg flew past Sim Ah-ryeon's face and hit the truck window.</p><p>“Kyaaa!”</p><p>“Now, Keongkeongi will appear. Everyone, our Keongkeongi is very gentle but still young and lacks composure. So please don’t provoke him.”</p><p>“We agreed to call that [bad temperament]...”</p><p>Thud. Thud. Thud.</p><p>Keongkeongi emerged from the forest, his majestic figure towering. He was the largest among the horses I had raised so far. His hind legs were exceptionally massive compared to his somewhat slender front legs.</p><p>Above all, he had a beautiful head.</p><p>Seo Gyu punched the air.</p><p>“Of course! A T. rex should make an appearance! And it’s even a featherless version! Fuck, who cares about scientific accuracy!”</p><p>“Gurgle...”</p><p>For the first time in a while, Seo Gyu uttered a curse as SG Man, while Sim Ah-ryeon collapsed next to him.</p><p>She must have fainted from overwhelming emotion. It was understandable given how handsome Keongkeongi was.</p><p><em>Grrroooar!</em></p><p>Keongkeongi, seeing his dad, expressed his delight.</p><p>“Did you hear that? Keongkeongi is the youngest of our ranch and loves goat meat the most.”</p><p>“A carnivorous horse...?”</p><p>“Of course. Why do you criticize our boy for eating meat?”</p><p>“Aha. Until now, I wondered why the Undertaker didn’t have a family or even a pet. But seeing this today, I realize it’s fortunate you don’t have children or pets...”</p><p>Thud! Thud!</p><p>Keongkeongi, charging with his powerful hind legs, ran towards me. I, too, raised my aura and hugged Keongkeongi’s head with both arms.</p><p>“Oh, there, there. Did you miss Dad a lot?”</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p><em>Grrroooar!</em></p><p>“That’s right. Don’t spill your food while eating. Here’s the goat hind leg you dropped. Chew it well.”</p><p><em>Grrr! Grrroar!</em></p><p>“How is it? Isn’t our Keongkeongi cute?”</p><p>“......”</p><p>Unfortunately, there was no answer from the fainted Sim Ah-ryeon, and Seo Gyu was too busy observing Keongkeongi to respond. So, Noh Do-hwa, who prided herself on being devoid of a soul, had to answer.</p><p>“You’re just overpowering a T. rex with brute strength...”</p><p>Thus, after decorating the highlight of the safari tour, we returned leisurely to our accommodation. For the record, Sim Ah-ryeon remained unconscious the whole time.</p><p>I smiled broadly.</p><p>“So, Noh Do-hwa, what are your thoughts after inspecting our ranch’s achievements?”</p><p>“Hmm...”</p><p>“I think Keongkeongi is the most suitable as the mount for our future cavalry.”</p><p>“Hmm...”</p><p>“Raising them is not easy, but if you grant us the time and budget, I will surely cultivate 1,000 Keongkeongis to create the world’s strongest cavalry. Oh, and all cavalrymen must blow the horn I made during charges.”</p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p>Noh Do-hwa also smiled broadly.</p><p>It was a rare smile for her.</p><p>“Bullshit.”</p><p>Why?</p><p>Epilogue 1.</p><p>In the end, Keongkeongi’s cavalry debut was canceled, but the achievements of Idea Ranch were not entirely ignored.</p><p>“Undertaker. Does that huge dinosaur, Byojoki or whatever it’s called, eat a lot...?”</p><p>“No. Thanks to the wonders of void genetics, it absorbs most of the energy it needs for biological activity through its skin. And it’s a horse, not a dinosaur.”</p><p>“Whether it’s a dinosaur or a horse, that’s good news. From now on, the National Road Management Corps will use Byojoki for transporting goods...”</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>Additionally, for military mounts for the awakeners, Kongkongi, the head-butting specialized horse, was selected instead of Keongkeongi.</p><p>Naturally, I fiercely protested this absurd decision.</p><p>“No! The essence of a cavalry unit is to be stylish! What’s the romance in cavalrymen riding Kongkongis?”</p><p>“But doesn’t Keongkeongi eat nearly 100kg of meat a day...? On the other hand, Kongkongi requires little food and is docile. I don’t see a reason to hesitate...”</p><p>“Damn it! A cavalry unit is not about efficiency!”</p><p>“Then let’s call it a mobile unit instead of a cavalry unit, or even a dinosaur unit. Hell, I don’t mind calling the National Road Management Corps by its name...”</p><p>How could a person have such an insensitive perspective?</p><p>As a result, from the 380th cycle onward, awakeners occasionally rode Kongkongis around the Korean Peninsula. This was limited to the cycles in which I managed Idea Ranch.</p><p>I returned sadly and rode alone on Keongkeongi’s back. A red sunset was setting beyond the horizon.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Keongkeongi. It seems I can’t make a mate for you...”</p><p><em>Grrroooar.</em></p><p>It’s okay, Keongkeongi replied, saying he found value in philosophical exploration rather than in a romantic relationship.</p><p>Ah! How heartbreaking.</p><p>Saddened, I blew the horn while riding on Keongkeongi’s back.</p><p><em>Wooooooo!</em></p><p><em>Grrroooar!</em></p><p>Against the backdrop of a fiery sunset, a man and a horse roared.</p><p>Humanity’s romance with the cavalry had finally come to an end.</p><p>Epilogue 2.</p><p>“Seo Gyu, I watched the dinosaur movie you recommended. But I didn’t like it.”</p><p>“Huh? How many did you watch?”</p><p>“Six. I watched the final one first since it was the last. The subtitle was Dominion. Why did you recommend such a movie?”</p><p>“No, hyung, fuck...”</p><p>Footnotes:</p>
