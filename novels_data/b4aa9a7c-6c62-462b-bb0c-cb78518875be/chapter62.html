<p>Puppeteer II</p><p>To put it bluntly, I had no respect for the Second Provisional Government. I respected my eye crust more and didn't want to be unnecessarily rude.</p><p>The problem was the Fukuoka city government.</p><p>The ones who leaked the information about my visit to the provisional government were likely from that side.</p><p>At this point, unlike the Korean Peninsula, the governmental organizations in the Japanese archipelago hadn't completely collapsed yet.</p><p>Therefore, they had the luxury to hold on to the "provisional government" coin without discarding it.</p><p>Who knows? This coin might rocket to Mars' atmosphere.</p><p>It was an extremely irrational judgment, but gamblers are often resistant to rational persuasion. Moreover, the Japanese had the sweet success story of the Lee Wan-yong coin etched in their minds.</p><p>The point when the Japanese government began regaining its rationality was much later, with the descent of the eight million monstrosities. It was a good trade, except for the price of offering heads, arms, torsos, legs, and innards for wisdom.</p><p>I would eventually take down a monstrosity called Inunaki... but all these tales are for later.</p><p>It wasn't yet a realized future.</p><p>Therefore, for now, I had to consider Fukuoka's authorities' dignity.</p><p>My task was to abduct an A-class awakener residing in Fukuoka without causing a fuss. Provoking the locals would be foolish.</p><p>Of course, in my 180th cycle, I could have kidnapped the Puppeteer without caring about politics, but at this point, I was merely a novice in my 18th cycle.</p><p>What could I do? Sometimes, you have to do dirty work.</p><p>"Haha. To have a patriot like you supporting our provisional government feels like gaining a thousand troops!"</p><p>"Oh, support is too grand a word. I just want to share the hardships of my compatriots abroad during these tough times."</p><p>"Ahaha, I see. Truly humble! Here! Please accept a drink, Mr. Undertaker!"</p><p>In the end, I spent the night drinking with the provisional government officials. While Jung Sang-guk might have enjoyed the 'sweet conversations with the war hero Undertaker' more than the alcohol.</p><p>Anyway, I sang his praises enough to make Jung Sang-guk satisfied.</p><p>"By the way... what brings you to Fukuoka?"</p><p>"Ah, it's more of a business matter than official duty."</p><p>"Oh, in these times, what's the difference between business and official duty? Any business you undertake is practically a national project. Please, do tell me."</p><p>"Your words put me at ease. I'm looking for an awakener known by the codename Puppeteer who resides in Fukuoka. Do you know of them?"</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>"...Puppeteer?"</p><p>For the first time, Jung Sang-guk stuttered.</p><p>"Yes, Puppeteer."</p><p>"...I know them very well. But why...?"</p><p>"As you know, I run a small academy, a training facility exclusively for awakeners. I'd like to see this Puppeteer in person and, if suitable, invite them to enroll in our academy."</p><p>"I see..."</p><p>The former mayor of Busan stared at me and muttered.</p><p>"...Maybe this is for the best."</p><p>It was a murmur whose meaning eluded me. The silence between us stretched for a couple of seconds before Jung Sang-guk awkwardly broke it.</p><p>"Do you smoke?"</p><p>I was a staunch anti-smoker, but that question was a signal for a private chat outside.</p><p>For that, I could temporarily sacrifice my lung health. Some people even abandoned their homeland, so what was a little smoke?</p><p>"Yes, I am desperate for one."</p><p>"Let's go. I can't stand the heat, need some fresh air."</p><p>We left the bar and polluted the night sky of the city.</p><p>As the level of fine dust in Fukuoka rose appropriately, a rather remarkable sight unfolded.</p><p>"Oh. A shooting star."</p><p>"Oh? Really."</p><p>A few meteors fell from the night sky. It was more of a sprinkle than a meteor shower.</p><p>Soon the cosmic rain ceased. Jung Sang-guk, however, was barely looking at the meteors, nervously glancing around.</p><p>"What's wrong?"</p><p>"I'm envious of you, Mr. Undertaker."</p><p>"Sorry?"</p><p>"Sometimes I imagine how great it would be if I were an awakener."</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>Jung Sang-guk pulled out a portable ashtray with trembling hands and stubbed his cigarette into it.</p><p>In that gesture, I didn't see his neatness but rather the survival instinct of someone living abroad.</p><p>If he had carelessly flicked the ash on the streets of Fukuoka, passing Japanese might wonder, ‘Does this Korean think of our land as an ashtray?’</p><p>"Puppeteer is my daughter."</p><p>I was so focused on the portable ashtray that I reacted a bit late.</p><p>"...What?"</p><p>"Puppeteer, Ha-yul. Lee Ha-yul. She's my daughter. If you take her, please take good care of her."</p><p>This was unexpected.</p><p>Just as I was about to ponder the peculiarities of fate, I quickly came up with a question.</p><p>"Wait a moment. Aren’t you Mr. Jung? Pardon me for asking, but if your daughter's surname is Lee..."</p><p>"Ah. She took her mother's surname."</p><p>Could it be that he believed a child should inherit not only the father's surname but also the mother's?</p><p>But my imagination was too limited.</p><p>The former mayor of Busan smiled. It seemed a forced smile.</p><p>"She's my second... a hidden daughter."</p><p>Damn.</p><p>The first day's schedule ended.</p><p>After that, I had 2 nights and 3 days of alone time. The provisional government had arranged my accommodation.</p><p>‘He’s something else, alright.’</p><p>Even with the country falling apart, he managed to flee abroad with his second family. A true hero who could even use teleportation had to be different.</p><p>Long ago, when Emperor Gaozu of Han was defeated by the demonic Xiang Yu and had to flee, he was forced to climb onto a carriage.</p><p>At that time, Liu Bang threw his children off the carriage, claiming it was overweight. Those who had played RPGs would understand that having a full inventory was an unforgivable sin for a player.</p><p>However, in the game of the Chu-Han Contention, children were designated as essential items, and a warning popped up, saying, [It's unacceptable to discard them!]. He failed to abandon them in the end.</p><p>This is why people need to learn martial arts. If Liu Bang had mastered the teleportation technique like Jung Sang-guk, he could have committed such atrocities without relying on a weak carriage.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>"Mr. Undertaker, are you there?"</p><p>Knock, knock.</p><p>Just as I was testing the boundary between meditation and daydreaming, a martial arts master visited. It was our first reunion in two days.</p><p>Jung Sang-guk handed me a piece of paper with Puppeteer's address written on it.</p><p>His appearance was odd. Despite the warm spring day, he wore gloves and had a rather strong fragrance.</p><p>He even declined to accompany me to Puppeteer's house.</p><p>"Why? Aren’t you coming with me?"</p><p>"I'm sorry."</p><p>Jung Sang-guk smiled awkwardly.</p><p>It was a smile unbecoming of a politician. His expression was stiffer than it had been at the drinking party.</p><p>"My daughter is going through a strong rebellious phase these days..."</p><p>"But wouldn't you be worried about me meeting your daughter alone?"</p><p>"Oh, no. Not at all. Besides, there's a housekeeper at Ha-yul's place, so it's fine."</p><p>"Hmm."</p><p>"More importantly, I talked to Ha-yul about you yesterday. You don't need to worry."</p><p>"Got it. See you in the evening."</p><p>Actually.</p><p>I should have noticed the oddity then.</p><p>If Jung Sang-guk's second family was functioning properly, the housekeeper wouldn't be there but rather his daughter's biological mother.</p><p>Moreover, it was strange that someone who had struggled so hard to win my favor suddenly refused to accompany me.</p><p>But what could I do?</p><p>I checked the address and asked locals for directions, eventually arriving at Lee Ha-yul's house.</p><p>Knock, knock—I knocked on the door handle attached to the entrance (few people used electronic doorbells due to electricity conservation) to announce my visit.</p><p>"Is anyone home?"</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>Knock, knock.</p><p>"Hello, I'm the Undertaker. I'm here on Mr. Jung Sang-guk's recommendation. Is anyone home?"</p><p>Knock, knock.</p><p>"......"</p><p>It was purely my experience as a regressor who had gone through countless hardships that made me sense the foreboding then.</p><p>I turned the doorknob. It was unlocked.</p><p>"......"</p><p>As I stepped into the foyer, my sight was filled with cobwebs.</p><p>The corridors, living room, and first-floor staircase of the house were covered in giant cobwebs. Like an abandoned house.</p><p>No matter how hard life abroad was or how illegitimate a child, it was too odd for the daughter of the head of the provisional government to live in such conditions.</p><p>'No, are these even cobwebs? They are too big.'</p><p>Rustle—</p><p>Something was under my shoe. A doll.</p><p>Distracted by the cobwebs, I hadn't noticed the dolls placed all around the house.</p><p>"Lee Ha-yul?"</p><p>I carefully navigated the house, avoiding the dolls.</p><p>Figures, Russian matryoshka dolls, Japanese Ichimatsu dolls, Barbie dolls, ball-jointed dolls, stuffed dolls, paper flower dolls.</p><p>Literally a house of dolls.</p><p>Or perhaps a spider's nest.</p><p>A woman in her 40s, presumed to be the housekeeper, was found dead, hanged by cobwebs in the second-floor bedroom.</p><p>"......"</p><p>I was used to corpses. I didn't panic, but seeing the 13 dolls surrounding the corpse as if in prayer was a first.</p><p>It wasn't the only first.</p><p>Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>Dolls attached to strings moved up and down around the corpse.</p><p>Like playing on a seesaw at a playground.</p><p>I had no idea what kind of mechanism it was, but the strings wrapped around the dolls' wrists extended to the corpse's 'jaw' and 'hands.'</p><p>So, as the dolls moved up and down, the corpse's jaw clicked, and the fingers wiggled weirdly. Yes. Like a nutcracker.</p><p>"What the...?"</p><p>The stench was overwhelming.</p><p>Judging by the rigor mortis, she had been dead for over 30 hours. At least 30 hours, but it felt much longer.</p><p>That was strange.</p><p>Over 30 hours meant it wasn't yesterday but the day before.</p><p>Moreover, Jung Sang-guk had testified that he met his daughter yesterday and told her about me. So, the housekeeper was already dead by then?</p><p>'Strange.'</p><p>I instinctively felt that Jung Sang-guk had lied to me.</p><p>Especially the gloves. His out-of-season gloves bothered me.</p><p>I left the 'house of dolls' and returned to my lodging. I planned to gather my belongings and track down Jung Sang-guk.</p><p>Soon, it turned out I didn't need to.</p><p>Jung Sang-guk's corpse was hanging from cobwebs in the middle of my lodging.</p><p>"......"</p><p>How?</p><p>Something was off. No, it was dangerous. Even though Jung Sang-guk was a powerless traitor, finding his body in my room was bad news.</p><p>My mind quickly cooled.</p><p>A familiar sensation.</p><p>I acted swiftly.</p><p>'I need to handle this.'</p><p>Fwoosh—!</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>Without investigating further, I immediately incinerated the body. Completely. Using all my aura to erase any trace, including my own.</p><p>Only someone who had accumulated inner power over multiple cycles like me could perform such a feat effortlessly.</p><p>'59 seconds.'</p><p>I grabbed a book and walked out of the lodging casually. I greeted the staff brightly on purpose.</p><p>To them, I would appear as 'a guest who briefly entered and left the room.' It would be hard to believe that a body was incinerated in such a short time.</p><p>Now, I only had to worry about witnesses. Anyone who might have seen Jung Sang-guk enter my room.</p><p>No need to worry about CCTV. Nowadays, CCTV was rare. Not because of electricity but because they were prone to being infected by monstrosities, making people avoid them.</p><p>I asked the lodging staff, 'Have you seen Mr. Jung?' They shook their heads, saving their lives.</p><p>So far, four minutes had passed.</p><p>While not a perfect alibi, it was sufficient for plausible deniability.</p><p>I hadn't committed any murder.</p><p>That was the truth.</p><p>And I was strong.</p><p>The power of truth sometimes wielded sharp blades even in the hands of the weak. In the hands of the strong, it was unmatched.</p><p>'Scho, old man. I'll make sure to charge you well for this trip.'</p><p>I headed back to the house of dolls.</p><p>This time stealthily, without anyone noticing.</p><p>―Circumstantially, the 'culprit' was almost certainly Jung Sang-guk's illegitimate daughter, Lee Ha-yul.</p><p>Evidence was unnecessary. I was neither a detective nor a cop. I was a regressor. I could verify evidence in other cycles.</p><p>What mattered now was to gather as much information as possible about the culprit, Lee Ha-yul, to gain an advantage in future cycles.</p><p>It turned out to be necessary.</p><p>At the entrance, I found an awakener with bright chestnut hair, presumably Lee Ha-yul, dead.</p><p>"......"</p><p>Lee Ha-yul was in a wheelchair, stabbed in the chest by a knife held by a doll.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>I first realized then that the Puppeteer was a legless girl.</p><p>Without ever having heard her voice and knowing I would never hear it in the 18th cycle, I covered my forehead with my left hand before her corpse.</p><p>"That damned old man..."</p><p>Really.</p><p>I would charge a high price for this trip.</p><p>Footnotes:</p>
