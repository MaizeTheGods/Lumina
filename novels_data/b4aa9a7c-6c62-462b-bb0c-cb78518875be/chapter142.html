<p>The Lucky One I</p><p>As mentioned in the previous story, in this world, 'monopolizing fortuitous encounters' is impossible.</p><p>More precisely, it's possible, but the aftermath is unpredictable.</p><p>Like eating a high-carb dessert cake that's bad for your health.</p><p>"Hmm."</p><p>And I pondered the same way someone on a diet would when faced with a delicious cake.</p><p>On the table lay the Monkey's Paw.</p><p>'Where does fortuitous encounter end and pure luck begin?'</p><p>For example... yes.</p><p>I toured the best restaurants in Busan to quickly establish a connection with Dang Seo-rin.</p><p>A tour composed entirely of her favorite dishes.</p><p>This information was gathered by me personally, over repeated cycles.</p><p>Would the Total Luck Law anomaly consider such knowledge obtained by a regressor as 'luck'?</p><p>'If so, that's quite unfair. It would mean my regression ability is also considered luck.'</p><p>I smirked.</p><p>After some research, it seemed the Total Luck Law wasn't that strict.</p><p>I had sacrificed sweat, time, and sometimes my life to obtain the knowledge of a regressor.</p><p>These were not random strokes of luck but the result of relentless effort.</p><p>Thus, even if I consumed elixirs like the 'Heart of Ten Legs,' there were no side effects. Dok-seo's worries were unfounded.</p><p>'Hmm. Then what constitutes true luck?'</p><p>I couldn't help but be intrigued.</p><p>'Should I test it?'</p><p>Coincidentally, it was the 590th cycle. For someone like me who enjoyed 'vacation cycles' every 5 or 10 cycles, it was perfect timing.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>I finished my early schedule (recruiting the Saintess, enlisting Noh Do-hwa, etc.) after the regression.</p><p>Then I headed straight to Jeju Island.</p><p>The tutorial dungeon in Jeju Island had already been cleared. It opened much earlier than the one at Busan Station, so it was expected.</p><p>I picked up the Monkey's Paw near the top of Seongsan Ilchulbong, beside the already furry Kuro, and made my wish.</p><p>"Monkey's Paw, Monkey's Paw. Grant my wish."</p><p>-......</p><p>"First, give me endless luck."</p><p>Twitch. The Monkey's Paw trembled. This must be the correct way to make a wish.</p><p>"In other words, let me enjoy luck that I would never normally experience. Luck that seems nearly impossible."</p><p>-......!</p><p>"Second, let the side effects of this luck start exactly ten years from now."</p><p>-......! ......!</p><p>"Third, even if I make my wishes, delay turning my body into a furry creature for ten years. That's also a misfortune, isn't it?"</p><p>-......</p><p>At that moment, strange laughter echoed around me.</p><p>-Ukikikiki! Hee! Ukiki! Hik!</p><p>Monkey laughter. No, it was more like an AI mimicking monkey laughter, with an oddly mechanical sound.</p><p>Along with that sound, the Monkey's Paw suddenly disintegrated into powder.</p><p>"Oh."</p><p>If I had to interpret it, it seemed to say, 'Your wish is granted.'</p><p>The powder was all absorbed into my arm, but at a glance, there were no changes to my body.</p><p>'So, luck begins now.'</p><p>What events awaited me?</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>I stood at the summit of Seongsan Ilchulbong for a moment. But nothing happened.</p><p>"Hmm."</p><p>Was the wish granted properly?</p><p>I returned to the mainland, half-believing, half-doubting.</p><p>Despite being busy with settling the National Road Management Corps and various schedules, no overwhelming 'luck' occurred.</p><p>Just as I thought the Total Luck Law might not be so powerful and my wish might have failed—</p><p>Knock, knock.</p><p>Someone knocked on my office door. Since I hadn't yet subdued Inunaki Tunnel in this cycle, I was temporarily staying at the National Road Management Corps headquarters.</p><p>"Who is it?"</p><p>-I've heard the greatest swordsman in Korea is here, so I came to visit.</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>The voice of the visitor was one I had never heard before.</p><p>This was quite remarkable. As I mentioned, this happened in the 590th cycle. By this time, I had met almost every person living in Busan.</p><p>As Old Man Scho would say, 'just in case there's a [Teleporter] somewhere in this world,' I usually tried to befriend unfamiliar people.</p><p>But a completely new voice?</p><p>And this person claimed to be looking for the greatest swordsman in Korea. Quite a character, yet someone I didn't know?</p><p>"I don't know what brings you here, but please come in."</p><p>-Then I'll be entering.</p><p>The door opened.</p><p>How should I describe it?</p><p>An incredibly handsome young man stood there.</p><p>"Uh..."</p><p>Those who have heard my tales would know that I don't usually comment on others' appearances.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>If I used expressions like 'beautiful' or 'pretty,' it meant the person's appearance had an overwhelming charm that couldn't be ignored.</p><p>Just as you must call a mountain a mountain, beautiful things must be acknowledged as beautiful.</p><p>This boy's face was so 'irresistible,' it seemed like a miracle bestowed upon humanity by nature.</p><p>Therefore, the boy standing before me had a radiance in his appearance unlike any man I had ever seen.</p><p>Gray hair. Not the dull color of aging, but a vibrant shade. It was proof that the stranger was an awakener.</p><p>His fashion was peculiar. Traditional Korean clothing? No, more like tattered hemp clothes from the Joseon Dynasty.</p><p>Even with such a -30 debuff in attire, it didn't diminish the visitor's aura at all.</p><p>I was surprised again.</p><p>I hadn't seen this person once in 590 cycles?</p><p>Even if I hadn't met him, his looks should have been frequently mentioned on SG Net.</p><p>"Oh, I'm sorry. I was staring at your face. My apologies."</p><p>"No problem."</p><p>His voice, too, was remarkably refreshing.</p><p>Only then did I realize how strange the visitor's speech was.</p><p>His voice was so striking that I hadn't noticed the content.</p><p>If there were a male version of Go Yuri, it might be at this level.</p><p>'Weird. This speech pattern is familiar. Where have I heard it before...?'</p><p>I couldn't recall.</p><p>The gray-haired boy spoke very politely.</p><p>"More importantly, are you the greatest swordsman in Korea, the one who slashed two hearts of Ten Legs, the Undertaker?"</p><p>"Yes? Oh, yes. While I had help from other awakeners, it's true that my alias is the Undertaker."</p><p>"Hmm. I have come to the right place."</p><p>The boy tapped his waist. Even his finger movements were elegant.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>A sword hilt hung at his waist. It looked like a wooden sword, not a real one.</p><p>"I am also on the path of a warrior, albeit clumsily. I have heard of your fame and came despite the rudeness of an initial meeting. Would you kindly exchange a bout with me?"</p><p>"...Oh."</p><p>Wait a minute.</p><p>'Referring to oneself as a warrior? An aluminum sword?'</p><p>――A terrifying premonition struck me.</p><p>It felt like standing at the edge of a swamp where I couldn't use my lightness skill and had to wade in wearing sandals, a strange feeling.</p><p>But I, the Undertaker, known for mental resilience, suppressed the unease and spoke calmly.</p><p>"...Hmm. I'm always up for martial practice, but may I know your name?"</p><p>"Oh dear. Look at me. I forgot to introduce myself. As I age, I should be more courteous, but I still forget such things. Hoho."</p><p>Swipe.</p><p>The boy, who looked about eighteen, clasped his hands together and bowed. It was a perfectly executed bow, reminiscent of old Hong Kong movies.</p><p>"I am called Sword Marquess. A noble of the defunct Sirland Duchy and the Sect Leader of the Mount Hua Sect."</p><p>"......"</p><p>"I recently attained enlightenment and reversed my aging. But rather than being content with this state, I believe a warrior must continue to train. Thus, I am seeking strong warriors across the land. Undertaker, I humbly request a duel with you!"</p><p>"......"</p><p>This is driving me crazy.</p><p>The Sword Marquess... This self-proclaimed crazy martial arts fanatic was incredibly strong.</p><p>"Hoho! Indeed, the world is vast, and there are many masters in the martial arts realm! To think there was such a great swordsman in this remote region. I have learned much!"</p><p>"Uh, yes..."</p><p>I won the duel. But winning against as a 590-cycle regressor was a given.</p><p>The issue was the process.</p><p>The Sword Marquess fought me to a standstill for 101 rounds.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>Aside from anomalies like the Sword Demon from the Dream Within a Dream vast void, he was at a level that could claim to be the best in the world.</p><p>He had the power to hold a front line against anomalies alone, this gray-haired maniac before me.</p><p>It was an excellent addition to our forces.</p><p>So I should have been happy.</p><p>But...</p><p>"Master, you are quite skilled..."</p><p>"Hoho! Although I am older, how can I accept such compliments from a younger, superior swordsman? Don't make this old man feel embarrassed."</p><p>"Yes..."</p><p>"Hmm! I will stay in Dongnae for a while. I am not yet ready to restore the glory of the Mount Hua Sect. I intend to train solely until I can at least match your skill, Undertaker."</p><p>"......"</p><p>Why did this feel so off?</p><p>Was this crazy martial arts fanatic really like this back in the day? Was he actually this good with the sword?</p><p>Am I supposed to believe this, anomaly?</p><p>"Heh."</p><p>"......?"</p><p>No, this was all an illusion by Go Yuri!</p><p>Damn it. To think she used such a trick without me noticing! Go Yuri, you are a terrifying child...!</p><p>I tried various methods to torture my cheeks but I didn't wake from the dream.</p><p>Damn it.</p><p>"Why are you doing that? It's not good for a young man to have a habit of self-harm."</p><p>I'm older than you by thousands of times.</p><p>No, that's not the point.</p><p>"Sir. You mentioned you experienced enlightenment and reversed your aging?"</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>"Yes, that's right."</p><p>"As you know, the world is dangerous these days, and such an event could be the work of an anomaly. Could you tell me specifically how you achieved this enlightenment?"</p><p>"Ah, no problem. The essence of enlightenment should be shared among friends!"</p><p>The Sword Marquess stroked his chin.</p><p>As if there were an invisible long beard there.</p><p>To the point where this performance art reached a level of expertise.</p><p>"I was meditating on the beach of Yuldoguk when it happened."</p><p>So, you were fishing on the beach of Ulleungdo? Got it.</p><p>"Suddenly, even though it wasn't night yet, the sky beyond the horizon turned into the Milky Way."</p><p>"......?"</p><p>"That's right. I suddenly had a moment of enlightenment. I realized the boundary between day and night is merely a human distinction, a fleeting moment in the endless cycle of time, where light and darkness alternate. Everything in the world is like that. Day and night hold their own beauty, and it is the privilege of individuals to appreciate these moments. Hoho! Thus, my desire to prolong this privilege is not selfish but a dedication to all transient beings!"</p><p>I apologize for transcribing this lengthy monologue, but the Sword Marquess really said all that.</p><p>I wanted to interrupt, but it was tricky. Sometimes I forgot, but this man (formerly old) held the key to our food supply.</p><p>I couldn't risk offending him.</p><p>"So... after attaining enlightenment...?"</p><p>"I woke up to find I had reversed my aging. Hohoho."</p><p>What is that?</p><p>That's just pure luck—oh.</p><p>Oh!</p><p>'Pure luck!'</p><p>I finally remembered the wish I made to the Monkey's Paw in Jeju Island a year ago.</p><p>That's right.</p><p>The Sword Marquess 'luckily' 'happened' to achieve enlightenment on the beach and reversed his aging.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>This was sheer luck. An encounter that had never occurred in 590 cycles!</p><p>I glanced at the Sword Marquess. The old young man was laughing heartily.</p><p>And.</p><p>As will be revealed from now on, the Sword Marquess's reversal of aging was just the beginning of the 'lucky' events I would experience in the 590th cycle.</p><p>Footnotes:</p>
