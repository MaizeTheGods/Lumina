<p>[Infinite Regression Genre]
In any fantasy novel, regression is a guaranteed cheat key!
</p><p>What if it’s the ability of [Infinite Regression]?<br/>
There’d be no need to worry about any bad endings. After all, the protagonist would eventually reach a happy ending.</p>
<p>“Cheat key, my foot.”</p>
<p>I tried it myself just to find out otherwise.</p>
<p>The myths of regressors’ success depicted in all those novels are actually fake…<br/>
It was all just vile propaganda!</p>
<p>“This run is doomed too.”</p>
<p>This is not a story of success; it’s a tale on the aftermath of failures.<br/>
Thus begins the heartfelt documentary of a man with 1183 runs of experience!</p>
