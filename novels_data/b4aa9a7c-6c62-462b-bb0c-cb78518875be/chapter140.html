<p>The Impostor II</p><p>“Wait, hold on, mister!”</p><p>Oh Dok-seo, who had been listening to my story, was startled. She spoke so abruptly that some espresso splashed around.</p><p>“That, that means that Japanese person was a regressor!”</p><p>“Calm down.”</p><p>“How can I calm down? If there's another person besides Old Man Scho and you, that makes three regressors!”</p><p>“Well, for now, just calm down.”</p><p>I calmly wiped the table with a handkerchief. Dok-seo, who had been focused on the Monkey's Paw, was now entirely captivated by the diary. The page with the sentence ‘Time is looping’ lay open.</p><p>“I was just as excited as you when I read that sentence in the diary.”</p><p>It was only natural. How could my heart not race?</p><p>If a ‘Third Regressor’ existed, it would be an incredible discovery.</p><p>Even if the person was found dead at Seongsan Ilchulbong, it didn't matter. There was still a possibility they would survive in the next cycle.</p><p>But to spoil things a bit, no such miracle occurred.</p><p>In the next cycle, and the one after that.</p><p>No matter how much time passed, the hairy corpse remained in the corner of Seongsan Ilchulbong.</p><p>“Can I read it too? The diary?”</p><p>“Sure. Unlike the Monkey's Paw, that diary is just an ordinary notebook.”</p><p>“Thanks, mister!”</p><p>Flip.</p><p>Dok-seo hurriedly turned the pages.</p><p>For a moment, her actions overlapped with my own past self.</p><p>When I first discovered that diary.</p><p>《Day 5???》</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>It happened again. Centaurs attacked and started killing our party.</p><p>Why do we keep returning to Day 5? Was it because of the wish I made with the Monkey's Paw?</p><p>I don't know anymore.</p><p>Knowing the ambush was coming, we managed to drive the centaurs away without losing anyone this time. The party members praised me for it.</p><p>Even the usually stoic Yō looked at me with surprise, but for some reason, I didn't feel happy.</p><p>To you, this will note might look neatly written, but the reality was different.</p><p>The handwriting in the diary grew more chaotic, resembling the scrawl of a madman.</p><p>Occasionally, when sanity returned, the writing was neat, but it was only a façade.</p><p>The content of the diary reflected the writer's deteriorating mental state, spiraling rapidly into madness.</p><p>《Day 12??????》</p><p>It's certain. No matter what I do, I can't leave this dungeon.</p><p>Next, I'll try capturing and interrogating the ‘fairy’ who seems to be the host of this death game. That bitch should have some information.</p><p>《Day 13??????》</p><p>The fairy ran away as soon as it saw me.</p><p>‘Hoeeek! This is the wrong place! It's a mistake!’ it said. I don't understand.</p><p>I wanted to capture it by force, but honestly, it was impossible. When it swung something that looked like a magic wand, people died instantly and it turned invisible.</p><p>I've reached the final stage again. Koreans call this mountain Seongsan Ilchulbong.</p><p>When others reached the summit, they disappeared into a bright halo of light. But I remained inside the dungeon.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Why can't I leave the dungeon?</p><p>I begged the Monkey's Paw to let me out of this dungeon, but nothing changed. Why?</p><p>I wished to see my family and friends again, but there was no response. Why?</p><p>In a fit of anger, I threw the Monkey's Paw away. The next day, I woke up with it on my chest.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>《?????????????》</p><p>Someone please help me.</p><p>《Day 5??????????????》</p><p>Another Day 5 ambush.</p><p>Suddenly, I felt overwhelmingly apathetic. This time, I didn't bother to fight the centaurs.</p><p>Instead, I joined them. I attacked my party members from behind as they fought the centaurs. Without Yō and me, the group fell apart pathetically quickly.</p><p>I saved Yō for last. When she saw my face, she widened her eyes.</p><p>You――― she started to say.</p><p>At that moment, a centaur's massive body struck her.</p><p>When a human is trampled by a horse, they die in a ridiculous manner. It had been a while since I felt such pleasure. It was a bit fun.</p><p>The problem was that the centaurs, after wiping out our group, hunted me too.</p><p>What fools. As expected of monsters, they had no concept of cooperation or alliances.</p><p>“......”</p><p>I swallowed hard.</p><p>It was a typical sign of corruption.</p><p>The diary's owner, who believed herself to be a regressor, gradually lost her humanity.</p><p>Humanity only exists when people live together.</p><p>Conversely, if my space cannot interact with others and my time does not intersect with theirs, a person rapidly transforms into ‘something not human.’</p><p>The fallen Saintess who became the Executioner was a prime example.</p><p>The diary's owner was no different.</p><p>《Day 17???????????????????》</p><p>I reflect on my past self.</p><p>Reflecting on the past leads to the future. I have grown enough to believe that. In this space, no development is possible, so only self-discipline has meaning.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>Why did I hate Yō so much?</p><p>Because she looked like the girl Sena cheated with? Because her expression annoyed me? Because she seemed like a model student?</p><p>I repent my prejudice.</p><p>Now I like Yō. I really like her. Other people break down in three days, but Yō lasted nearly three weeks.</p><p>She kept muttering the name Rika— Rika—, someone who seemed important to her.</p><p>She said she had a promise to keep, to return home. It was laughably stupid.</p><p>《Day 20???????????????????》</p><p>The world outside this space must have already disappeared.</p><p>The concept of 'stage clear' does not exist. When people are enveloped in the light at the end, they actually die.</p><p>So, staying here with me is definitely better. Sometimes monsters pop out, but it's better than dying, right?</p><p>At this time, the Korean groups that split up at the start arrive one by one at the summit. But I didn't let them go.</p><p>I remembered the game &lt;Fall Guys&gt; that I enjoyed with Sena. You thought you reached the finish line? Too bad.</p><p>I hung Yō in the center of the crater. Then, I dragged everyone approaching the summit down the slope.</p><p>Roll, roll, roll. If they were lucky, they'd roll right into the crater and hit Yō. A hole-in-one.</p><p>I wondered why Korean students would go on a school trip to such a place, but I finally understood the true beauty of this location.</p><p>Depending on the angle and force, the rolling trajectory varied greatly. It was a deeply engaging game. I declared this place my private golf course. It's my property.</p><p>Some Korean shouted that I was a boss monster. How rude. I'm a young lady.</p><p>《Day 27???????????????????》</p><p>I felt a pang of fear after a long time.</p><p>A rather strong group rescued Yō and ambushed me. The last survivors must have banded together to form a death squad.</p><p>When a spear grazed my neck, I thought my heart would stop. I barely overcame the ambush and killed them.</p><p>I felt alive. This is what interaction between humans is like.</p><p>I gathered the wounded and killed them one by one in front of Yō. I took special care with the one who almost beheaded me.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>That Korean glared at me with fierce eyes until the end.</p><p>Too bad. Sorry, but I'm a human who maxed out 'luck' with the Monkey's Paw.</p><p>Yō made beautiful sounds. Wasn't the violin invented from human screams? I felt more cultured.</p><p>Flip.</p><p>The diary contained many passages that were hard to convey.</p><p>Unless one was deeply interested in gore or guro, it felt like a repetitive cycle of similar content.</p><p>Torture conducted solely to elicit new reactions from others. Even the Tutorial Fairy would respond with, ‘This is a bit much.’</p><p>But human reactions were not infinite. Creativity had limits.</p><p>In the end, the diary concluded with one last sentence on a page yellowed with age.</p><p>A staggering handwriting.</p><p>I'm sorry for being born.</p><p>Monkey's Paw, please make me disappear.</p><p>Thud.</p><p>I closed the diary. Then I looked down at the hairy corpse that originally held this will note with both hands.</p><p>The corpse's posture seemed as if it was praying to someone.</p><p>What exactly happened to the ‘hairy corpse’?</p><p>Was she really a Regressor? How did the Monkey's Paw work?</p><p>An ordinary person would find it hard to investigate further.</p><p>But I, the Undertaker, was a seasoned 'True Regressor.'</p><p>Even if something seemed useless at first glance, I never neglected building networks with others.</p><p>Therefore, I could easily inquire about the ‘Japanese person’ dragged into the tutorial dungeon in Jeju Island.</p><p>“Nya? You mean Yō?”</p><p>Sway. Manyo Neko's tail swayed. Across from me, Manyo Neko blinked, interrupting her tea drinking.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>“You suddenly want to meet Yō, nya? What do you mean, Undateikeo, nya?”</p><p>“She’s your childhood friend, isn’t she? I heard she’s from the Jeju tutorial dungeon.”</p><p>Yō.</p><p>The person frequently mentioned in the diary was actually someone I was familiar with.</p><p>There were many people named Yō, but several pieces of evidence convinced me.</p><p>She was stronger than other awakeners. She still had black hair despite being awakened. Most importantly, she murmured the name ‘Rika’ while being tortured.</p><p>That’s right. She was mentioned a few times in the Inunaki Tunnel episode.</p><p>Manyo Neko's real name was Rika, and she had a childhood friend named Yō.</p><p>If I hadn't conquered the Inunaki Tunnel, I wouldn't have been able to request this meeting.</p><p>Fate is mysterious.</p><p>“Nya. It’s true that Yō was spirited away to a Korean island…”</p><p>“I’ve been investigating the Jeju dungeon recently. It’s linked to a troublesome anomaly. I need to hear your friend’s testimony.”</p><p>For reference, the Magical Girl Association was extremely exclusive to outsiders.</p><p>From naming their group 'Magical Girl' 'Association,' it was clear they cared little for public opinion.</p><p>“Nya, if it's a request from the Undateikeo, I'll comply. Got it!”</p><p>Also, I had received a plaque of appreciation from their leader, known as the Grand Shaman, naming me an 'Honorary Magical Girl.'</p><p>I didn't appreciate it much.</p><p>In any case, in a society run on networks, my request was easily fulfilled.</p><p>Soon, I met with Yō, whose Magical Girl name was Obsidian Qin.</p><p>“You wanted to see me?”</p><p>Among the many eccentrics in the Magical Girl Association, she was relatively normal.</p><p>Obsidian Qin covered her mouth with a black mask marked with an 'X.' For those who experienced the COVID era, this could be seen as fashion.</p><p>“Yes. We met briefly during the Inunaki Tunnel incident, right? Nice to see you again.”</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>“Ah… Yes. Thank you very much for that time.”</p><p>“I heard you conquered the tutorial dungeon at Seongsan Ilchulbong in Jeju.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“There’s an anomaly suspected to have originated there. I need your testimony to gauge its danger. Can you tell me what happened in the tutorial dungeon?”</p><p>I was cautious when bringing this up.</p><p>According to the diary, this person had likely been tortured by the diary's owner.</p><p>If even a fraction of the diary was true, Obsidian Qin would have a deep-seated trauma.</p><p>People usually react negatively when such buried topics are brought up.</p><p>A flinch or a shudder.</p><p>“That's news to me. Was there an anomaly so dangerous that the Undertaker would be interested?”</p><p>But Obsidian Qin's reaction was neither.</p><p>Her puzzled look contained only curiosity. It was too calm for someone with trauma.</p><p>Despite sensing something odd, I continued my inquiry.</p><p>“…Have you seen this figure before?”</p><p>The photo I took out showed the ‘hairy corpse.’</p><p>Finally, Obsidian Qin said, “Ah—” as if she recognized it.</p><p>But still, her reaction was strange for someone who had been deeply hurt.</p><p>“…I think I know who it is. Is this person related to what you want to know?”</p><p>“Yes. Any information, no matter how small, would be helpful.”</p><p>“I can share, but…”</p><p>Obsidian Qin frowned.</p><p>I tensed. This might be the moment I learned about the third Regressor.</p><p>“I’m not sure if it’ll help. Honestly, I don't know much about her.”</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>Her lips moved slowly beneath the black mask.</p><p>“—She was so weak that she died almost as soon as the tutorial dungeon began.”</p><p>Footnotes:</p>
