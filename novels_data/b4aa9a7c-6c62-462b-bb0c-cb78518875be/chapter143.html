<p>The Lucky One II</p><p>[Mr. Undertaker, there's a big problem.]</p><p>One night, the Saintess sent a message through Constellation Talk.</p><p>I jumped out of bed. It was 3 AM. For her to wake me at such an ungodly hour, it must have been an urgent event.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>[You mentioned before that in the 7th year, a ‘Meteor Shower’ anomaly would appear in the night sky and devastate Gyeongsangnam-do.]</p><p>“Yes, that’s correct.”</p><p>[Well, right now, an anomaly suspected to be the Meteor Shower has been observed over the East Sea. The observation point is Ulleungdo.]</p><p>What?</p><p>[A photo has also been uploaded to SG Net. Since it’s early morning, there are only 14 views, but please check it.]</p><p>I quickly changed out of my pajamas and rushed out.</p><p>The Sword Marquess, who had been sleeping curled up like a cat by my doorstep, followed suit.</p><p>“What’s happening at this hour, Sword Duke?”</p><p>I won’t explain how the Sword Marquess started calling me 'Sword Duke' instead of Undertaker. There were too many things in the world I didn’t want to explain, and most of those things were related to lunatics.</p><p>“There’s an anomaly appearing over the East Sea right now.”</p><p>“Hah! Such a vile thing daring to launch a night attack! Despicable!”</p><p>Tap, tap, tap—</p><p>The two of us sprinted across Haeundae Beach and naturally leapt into the sea.</p><p>It was like stepping on thin ice.</p><p>For me, it was aura; for the Sword Marquess, it was internal energy, harnessed to step and leap across the water.</p><p>“An anomaly in the middle of the sea, huh. I wonder if it’s an omen of good or bad fortune. I suppose it’s better than appearing on land, but it seems the Sword Duke thinks otherwise.”</p><p>Of course, it was an omen of bad fortune.</p><p>My ‘Regressor’s Schedule’ was as meticulously planned as if written by an obsessive-compulsive person with a severe anxiety disorder about time management.</p><p>While I allowed for about a week’s error margin for most events, the timing of ‘anomaly appearances’ was planned down to the minute.</p><p>‘The Meteor Shower isn’t supposed to appear for several more years. Could killing the Butterfly Effect in Beijing have caused this?’</p><p>This would severely disrupt my project to foster camaraderie among the awakeners under the guise of the Meteor Shower subjugation.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>My heart pounded with anxiety.</p><p>When we reached the vicinity of Ulleungdo and looked up, the night sky was filled with brilliant, multicolored streaks.</p><p>I muttered in astonishment.</p><p>“It really is the Meteor Shower...”</p><p>In truth, subduing the Meteor Shower itself wasn’t a problem.</p><p>A 590-cycle regressor couldn’t possibly fail to take down an early-stage boss of the Korean Peninsula.</p><p>But as I mentioned, this would completely throw off my plans.</p><p>How would I strengthen the unity of the Korean Awakeners’ Alliance? How would I solidify Dang Seo-rin’s position as the leader?</p><p>Surrounded by the night sky and the sea, my thoughts churned like waves.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Suddenly, a different light flickered beyond the Meteor Shower.</p><p>It flashed quickly.</p><p>A ‘disc-shaped’ object rapidly crossed the sky and collided head-on with the Meteor Shower.</p><p>-Splatter! Splatter! Little stars?</p><p>The Meteor Shower seemed puzzled. It tilted its head, metaphorically speaking.</p><p>For reference, an artificial sea-like space had spread around the Meteor Shower.</p><p>Naturally, the ‘disc-shaped flying object’ that hit the surface of the night sky was thrown off course.</p><p>Thunk, thunk, thunk—</p><p>The disc bounced off the Meteor Shower’s surface, like a stone skipping across water.</p><p>“......”</p><p>My jaw dropped.</p><p>‘No way, that’s a UFO?’</p><p>Indeed.</p><p>A mysterious flying object in the shape of a disc.</p><p>An alien species with the ultimate combat power but, unfortunately, with a Pokémon fire attribute vulnerable to water. As soon as it landed in the East Sea, it dissolved like sugar in water.</p><p>“Oh, oh, oh—oh oh oh?”</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>Thunk, thunk, thunk, thunk.</p><p>The UFO kept skipping.</p><p>-Ah? Ah? Little stars.</p><p>The Meteor Shower, bombarded repeatedly, died on the spot.</p><p>No, really, it died.</p><p>Meteor Shower subjugation complete.</p><p>Without the Korean awakeners lifting a finger, the early-stage boss exited the scene.</p><p>Thunk, thunk, thunk, thunk, thunk.</p><p>Meanwhile, the UFO skipped 89 more times along the Meteor Shower’s waves.</p><p>As a result, the UFO, which should have crashed in the middle of the East Sea, veered off in a completely unexpected direction.</p><p>Northward.</p><p>Not into the sea, but towards the land—North Korea.</p><p>“No, no!”</p><p>I screamed. My cry was genuine.</p><p>“Huh? What do you mean, no, Sword Duke?”</p><p>“If that crashes on land, it’s the end! There are 120 aliens in that saucer, and each one is stronger than you! It’ll be a catastrophe!”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The Sword Marquess’s expression changed.</p><p>“Then we must pursue it at once! I need to learn from them!”</p><p>“Yeah. Damn it.”</p><p>Despite the Sword Marquess’s madness, he was right about needing to pursue it.</p><p>I pushed my aura to its maximum and chased after the UFO, determined not to lose sight of it.</p><p>The Sword Marquess shouted behind me, “Wait, Sword Duke! Wait for me, Sword Duke!” but I ignored him.</p><p>I had no time to humor the ramblings of an old young man.</p><p>“Huff, huff. Huff, huff...!”</p><p>For the first time in a while, I ran until I was out of breath. I had run so far that I lost contact with the Saintess.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>To summarize, the UFO crash-landed even further north than North Korea.</p><p>Specifically, between Shenyang and Sinuiju. In the region known as Manchuria, the aliens were crawling out.</p><p>-Screech?</p><p>-Screech. Screech.</p><p>They looked like disgusting cockroaches spilling out of their lair.</p><p>But these cockroaches were strong. Very strong.</p><p>I hid in the bushes and observed the aliens from afar.</p><p>Despite being a sci-fi species, the aliens moved naturally, using footwork to explore the surroundings.</p><p>Well, if the genre were space opera instead of sci-fi, it wouldn’t be too different from traditional martial arts.</p><p>-Screech?</p><p>One alien tilted its head and dipped its foot into a stream.</p><p>Splash, splash.</p><p>A commendable spirit of challenge, but footbaths benefiting health was a privilege reserved for humans and Japanese macaques.</p><p>The alien dissolved from toe to head.</p><p>-Screech!</p><p>-Screech! Screech! Screech!</p><p>The aliens panicked.</p><p>They were probably saying things like, ‘Oh my God! How can such a terrible substance exist?’ ‘You witness your kind’s body melting like candle wax just from touching it, you roll a SAN check.’</p><p>The aliens became even more frantic.</p><p>-Screech!</p><p>-Screech! Screech!</p><p>They pulled out laser guns and started gathering rocks, soil, and minerals.</p><p>Bzzz—</p><p>Using incomprehensible technology, the Earth’s minerals were appropriated by the aliens.</p><p>-Screech, screech!</p><p>-Screech. Screech.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>The aliens used their lasers to collect materials and began building something.</p><p>The minerals hit by the laser beams floated in the air and were shaped in real-time. Into walls, pillars, and mysterious interior decorations.</p><p>In less than thirty minutes, a bizarre structure rose in the middle of Manchuria.</p><p>To compare its appearance to something on Earth... a termite mound?</p><p>But it was black. The surface of the termite mound was covered in a dark, lava-like liquid that constantly flowed down. It was an abominable structure at first glance.</p><p>-Screech.</p><p>-Screech, screech.</p><p>The aliens seemed to be admiring their craftsmanship, embracing each other and dancing joyfully.</p><p>They enjoyed their dance party for a while before entering their termite mound—no, their black ant fortress.</p><p>“......”</p><p>What was this?</p><p>Was that sinister fortress a foothold for invading Earth? Or an antenna tower signaling their refugee ships still wandering in space?</p><p>“Huff! Huff! Huff! Sword Duke. Finally... Huff, I caught up. As expected of a master of lightness skills, I’m late...”</p><p>“Shh. Be quiet. They’ll hear us.”</p><p>“Huff... Huff? That grotesque tower, what is it?”</p><p>“I don’t know. Other than that the aliens built it.”</p><p>I dug a proper trench for camouflage and went into hiding. Even if I had to abandon this cycle, I intended to uncover the aliens’ purpose.</p><p>Fortunately or unfortunately, I didn’t have to stay hidden for long.</p><p>The reason the aliens built that bizarre structure soon became clear.</p><p>Thud, thud, thud—</p><p>It started to rain.</p><p>From the aliens’ perspective, ‘the substance of death’ bombarded from the sky.</p><p>The Earth’s specialty, H₂O, poured endlessly on their black ant fortress.</p><p>The dark liquid flowing down the surface of the black ant fortress constantly drained away.</p><p>Peek—</p><p>Long after the rain stopped, the aliens peeked out from the fortress.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>-Screech?</p><p>-Screech, screech.</p><p>-Screech.</p><p>Surprisingly, the aliens were intact.</p><p>For starters, their armor had changed slightly.</p><p>Should I call it a raincoat? Anyway, they wore something akin to a black raincoat.</p><p>It seemed they had been tirelessly sewing inside the black ant fortress.</p><p>-Screech!</p><p>But anyone who has worn a raincoat knows it’s not entirely waterproof.</p><p>The newly modified armor wasn’t perfect either. Walking around the Earth’s humid surface for too long caused</p><p>them to gradually melt.</p><p>What were they, Ultraman with a three-minute limit?</p><p>In any case, the fact that they could hope to survive on this hellish, doomsday planet seemed precious to them.</p><p>-Screech! Screech!</p><p>The aliens gradually expanded the black ant fortress.</p><p>Not by building upwards, but by extending the real estate sideways.</p><p>Have you heard of ‘The Line,’ a project ambitiously pursued by Saudi Arabia but greatly downsized? Think of the Great Wall of China.</p><p>In short, the aliens’ black ant fortress started to resemble a ‘wall.’ As they kept expanding sideways, it naturally took that shape.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>And that wall... stretched west towards the Yellow Sea and east towards the East Sea.</p><p>‘No, no. Wait a minute.’</p><p>Eventually, the aliens’ ‘Black Wall’ spanned across Manchuria horizontally.</p><p>In other words.</p><p>‘If a Monster Wave occurs... it would be blocked by the Black Wall!’</p><p>Indeed, that’s what happened.</p><p>A few years later, when the ocean-class anomaly ‘Monster Wave’ swept across the world and finally reached the Korean Peninsula.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>But just before it could land on the Korean Peninsula, the Monster Wave faced an unexpected obstacle.</p><p>-Grr?</p><p>-Grrr?</p><p>A crappy-looking wall blocked their path.</p><p>At first, the Monster Wave wasn’t fazed. It advanced boldly. A mere wall wasn’t going to stop giants like Wall Maria.</p><p>-Screech!</p><p>-Screech! Screech!</p><p>The problem was that each of the 116 remaining aliens (some had died) boasted combat skills on par with Captain Levi.</p><p>Faced with these 116 Levi-level aliens, the Monster Wave was annihilated.</p><p>In the process of defeating an army of 200,000 monsters, not a single alien died.</p><p>Of course, the Monster Wave had an endless supply of reinforcements, so it repeated its attack the next month and the month after that. Each time, it was crushed.</p><p>Naturally, the Korean Peninsula south of the Black Wall remained safe.</p><p>Without needing Mo Gwang-seo’s Eastern Holy State performance or Sim Ah-ryeon’s Zero Requiem plan.</p><p>Without suffering any damage, the Korean Peninsula was completely free from the threat of the ‘Monster Wave,’ which had been deemed virtually impossible to subjugate.</p><p>“Is this... for real?”</p><p>My jaw dropped.</p><p>To be honest, my jaw remained dropped for several years.</p><p>So the real strategy against the ‘Monster Wave’ was to somehow use the Meteor Shower to skip a UFO across the sea, crash it into Manchuria, and let the aliens build their wall to block the Monster Wave?</p><p>And I’m supposed to believe this, anomaly?</p><p>“Lucky...”</p><p>Noh Do-hwa commented, sipping her coffee after hearing my story.</p><p>I couldn’t help but notice that her dark circles seemed lighter than in other cycles. Probably because everything she attempted was going well.</p><p>“But isn’t this due to your wish to the ‘Monkey’s Paw’ or something? Heh. I don’t care, but aren’t you going to be screwed in a few years...?”</p><p>“......”</p><p>“I’m really looking forward to what kind of crazy blues will hit you. I’ll be sure to get a VIP ticket and wait.”</p><p>This is driving me crazy.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>Footnotes:</p>
