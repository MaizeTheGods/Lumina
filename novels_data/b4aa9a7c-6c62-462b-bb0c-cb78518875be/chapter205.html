<p>──────</p><p>The Wicked One V</p><p>National Road Management Corps Conference Room.</p><p>"I'm sorry..."</p><p>Oh Dok-seo knelt down, raising her hands in surrender.</p><p>The others in the conference room looked at her with disdain. The shame and humiliation she felt were so intense that her deltoid muscles trembled, a weight only a teenager's fresh brain could bear.</p><p>"Pfft, <em>pffffft</em>..."</p><p>Sim Ah-ryeon, one of the people gathered for the meeting, finally had her moment, delivering a sound, verbal one-two punch.</p><p>"A Fallen One... An Awakener who got corrupted because she didn't want to write. Even I fell while blocking a Monster Wave as the Northern Saintess, but you... You're even less of a human being than I am. Please, grow up mentally. If you keep living like a child, you'll just be a burden to everyone around you."</p><p>"Damn it..."</p><p>Dok-seo trembled. To be publicly acknowledged as having a lower mental age than Old Man Goryeo—she must have been impressed with herself for achieving such a miracle of difficulty.</p><p>Noh Do-hwa, the commander of the National Road Management Corps, was also present in the conference room. She leaned her chin on her hand and looked at me.</p><p>"Is it really possible to become a Corrupted for such a ridiculous reason, Awakener Undertaker?"</p><p>"I'm as surprised as you are. It's the first time I've encountered something like this. But, well, I'm almost certain an Outer God meddled somewhere along the way."</p><p>"An Outer God...?"</p><p>"I think Dok-seo's absurd slump and burnout symptoms are a kind of curse stemming from the Admin of the Infinite Metagame."</p><p>A tiger leaves its skin behind when it dies, and an Outer God leaves traces even after being vanquished. In the past, a comparison to HxH would’ve explained it perfectly, but that figure has been afflicted with the same hiatus disease as Oh Dok-seo, so such metaphors no longer hold up.</p><p>In any case, it’s difficult to completely eliminate an Outer God-level anomaly. At best, they can be sealed. Like how a slightly foul smell still seeps out of a well-sealed kimchi container, the sealing of an Outer God leads to various side effects.</p><p>Since Dok-seo carries around the Infinite Metagame’s laptop in her inventory all the time, she’s constantly exposed to this curse.</p><p>"Ah, I see. So just as the guild leader of Baekhwa Girls' High sometimes has episodes of split personality, Oh Dok-seo has these bouts of slumps..."</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>"Exactly. It’s as if the AI has transformed, making her dependent on it and unable to write without it. It’s likely trying to reclaim dominance over Dok-seo by any means necessary."</p><p>"Y-yes! Mister is exactly right!" Dok-seo shouted urgently. To call it desperation would not be an exaggeration. "There’s no way I could truly hate writing...! I’ve always wanted to help you, Mister! I wanted to back then! Even now! But the evil Outer God keeps getting in my way...!"</p><p>Just then, Ah-ryeon muttered under her breath beside her, "Oh. Could it be that the reason I can’t stop being a villain on SG Net no matter what I do is also because of an Outer God’s influence? I thought it was weird... It must be..."</p><p>"......"</p><p>"......"</p><p>Oh Dok-seo fell silent. We all fell silent.</p><p>And as if nothing had happened, I spoke up.</p><p>"Dok-seo, you must have started manifesting a Corrupted’s Authority by now."</p><p>"Huh? Authority?"</p><p>"Yes. When the Saintess fell, she gained the power to freeze the world’s time indefinitely. Dang Seo-rin could command an entire city as if it were her own limbs. You’ve probably received a similar level of Authority."</p><p>"......"</p><p>"You’ve already got an idea, don’t you? That’s why you’ve realized you’ve become a Fallen One."</p><p>Dok-seo hesitated. "I do, but..."</p><p>"Tell us what it is. You can stop kneeling."</p><p>"O-okay."</p><p>She then took a laptop out of her backpack. "I’m not entirely sure yet... but I did notice something."</p><p>As expected of an artifact infused with anomalous technology, the laptop booted up in less than 0.1 seconds.</p><p>Soon, an AI chatbot appeared on the screen.</p><p>――――――――――</p><p><strong>&gt;&gt; Please enter a prompt…</strong></p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p><strong>※ GPT-MSYH can make mistakes. Double check important info.</strong></p><p>――――――――――</p><p>"This. When I used to write novels with this thing, the writing was a bit sloppy, right?"</p><p>"It was."</p><p>"Yeah... but as I kept leveling up while exploring the Voids, the AI seemed to level up with me."</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>"In fact, I even asked the AI how to cure my slump, and it suggested that I explore the Voids to gain more experience. Looking back, that was probably the Outer God trying to rebuild its presence."</p><p>So that’s what happened.</p><p>Dok-seo turned to Ah-ryeon. "Unnie, let’s play rock-paper-scissors for a bit."</p><p>"H-huh?"</p><p>"I want to test something. I’ll play paper, and you play rock. My ability only activates if I win."</p><p>"Oh, okay. I understand."</p><p>"Remember, I’m paper, and you’re rock. Rock-paper-scissors!"</p><p>Oh Dok-seo threw rock, and Sim Ah-ryeon threw scissors. Neither of them looked surprised.</p><p>"Alright. I just beat you, right? So, here’s what happens to anyone I win against."</p><p><em>Click-clack.</em></p><p>Dok-seo typed on the laptop.</p><p>――――――――――</p><p><strong>&gt;&gt; Describe what will happen to Sim Ah-ryeon in the next 2 minutes. Exclude death and injury, respect her character, and keep it to minor embarrassment.</strong></p><p>――――――――――</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p><em>Ding.</em></p><p>After a slight hesitation, the AI-MSYH quickly churned out a response.</p><p>――――――――――</p><p><em>MSYH &gt;&gt; Sim Ah-ryeon, a top-tier healer, outwardly showed no signs, but inwardly, she welcomed today’s incident.</em></p><p><em>‘Dok-seo has gotten a bit too cocky lately just because she’s gotten stronger.’</em></p><p><em>‘I could become a Corrupted too if I wanted. I’m only staying quiet because the guild leader told me to.’</em></p><p><em>‘I should log into SG Net anonymously and let everyone know what a nuisance Dok-seo has been...’</em></p><p><em>‘It’s for the public good!’</em></p><p>――――――――――</p><p>All eyes in the conference room turned to Ah-ryeon.</p><p>She was startled. "Huh? I never thought that!"</p><p>"......"</p><p>"That’s a lie! Everyone knows how much I care for Dok-seo! This is some twisted anomaly’s attempt to slander me!"</p><p>The AI-MSYH wasn’t done yet.</p><p><em>Tick-tick-tick. </em></p><p>More text scrolled onto the screen.</p><p>――――――――――</p><p><em>MSYH &gt;&gt; Of course, such petty thoughts of Sim Ah-ryeon were completely seen through by the Heavenly Demon Oh Dok-seo.</em></p><p><em>‘How pitiful!’</em></p><p><em>‘When the competent criticize, they talk about the world’s unfairness, and when the incompetent do, they blame personal shortcomings.’</em></p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p><em>‘Their kind only sees shadows, never the light. In truth, they have no eyes. Even when they do, it’s as if they don’t. Living yet dead, they exist like specks.’</em></p><p><em>This extraordinary insight was, indeed, the Heavenly Demon Oh Dok-seo’s wisdom, a being who had been reborn from a scholar into a martial artist, embodying both pen and sword.</em></p><p>――――――――――</p><p>All eyes in the conference room shifted to Dok-seo.</p><p>"N-no! There must have been a weird error in the data somehow, which is why I keep appearing as the Heavenly Demon!"</p><p>"......"</p><p>"But that doesn’t matter at all. It’s not important at all. Look at the next sentences!"</p><p>So we did.</p><p>――――――――――</p><p><em>MSYH &gt;&gt; The heavens are fair. They grant fortune to the virtuous and misfortune to the baseless.</em></p><p><em>So it was that Sim Ah-ryeon, though she stood still, suddenly sneezed. Startled by this, she tried to explain herself but tripped and fell, landing squarely on her backside—a farcical display that summed up her life.</em></p><p>――――――――――</p><p>Ah-ryeon blinked in confusion when suddenly—</p><p>"Ah... <em>Ahh-choo</em>!"</p><p>A sneeze burst from her.</p><p><em>Achoo! Achoo!</em></p><p>The sneezes wouldn’t stop, and soon enough, she was looking around with teary eyes.</p><p>"J-hust a moment! I’m sorry! I— <em>Ah-choo! </em>Suddenly, some dust got in my nose, and I can’t stop sneezing..."</p><p>Then, as Ah-ryeon stumbled around in panic, she tripped over the leg of a chair.</p><p>"Huh? Ah?"</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p><em>Thud!</em></p><p>In terms of physical ability, Sim Ah-ryeon was always tied for last place with Lee Ha-yul. It was no surprise that she lost her balance and fell.</p><p>"Ouch... It hurts..." A soft groan filled the conference room.</p><p>Though no one had touched her, she had managed to make a spectacle of herself all on her own.</p><p>The other members of the conference room, having witnessed the entire sequence of events, all turned to look at Dok-seo.</p><p>"Hmm..."</p><p>The teen took off her hat and scratched the back of her head.</p><p>"So, this is my Authority... as a Fallen One. I can control the actions of anyone I’ve defeated... Or, more accurately, I can ask the AI what will happen and then make it happen..."</p><p>Scenario Writing.</p><p>The ability to "foretell" what will happen in the world and then forcibly "enact" that prophecy.</p><p>That was the Authority of the newly born Corrupted.</p><p>It started as a simple pastime.</p><p>Or perhaps a small way to regain some motivation.</p><p>Oh Dok-seo confessed that this was why she first turned to the AI.</p><p>――――――――――</p><p><strong>I can’t shake this slump. How can I get my motivation for writing back?</strong></p><p><em>MSYH &gt;&gt; Slumps are a challenge that anyone can face.</em></p><p><em>MSYH &gt;&gt; The writer’s asset is experience. How about trying to experience things that most people haven’t, or delving deeper into experiences that everyone has had?</em></p><p><em>MSYH &gt;&gt; Every aspect of life has its pros and cons. To some, Voids may be poison, but to a writer, they can be an endless field of new experiences.</em></p><p>――――――――――</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>At first glance, the AI’s advice seemed reasonable. Dok-seo felt reassured because the answer was so mundane. After all, it was advice that anyone, not just an anomaly, could give.</p><p>――――――――――</p><p><strong>The Voids scare me. Anomalies terrify me. Gaining experience is good, but that experience feels like thorns growing inside my heart.</strong></p><p><em>MSYH &gt;&gt; What is a severe wound for one person may be nothing to another. It depends on one’s strength and mindset.</em></p><p><em>MSYH &gt;&gt; Strengthen your mind. Define yourself as a strong person, and develop the strength to match. An Awakener’s power is intrinsically interwoven with their mental fortitude.</em></p><p><em>MSYH &gt;&gt; As a first step in developing mental toughness, why not define yourself as a Heavenly Demon?</em></p><p>――――――――――</p><p>Like many anomalies, the Infinite Metagame gradually consumed Oh Dok-seo’s mind. She spent nearly every moment, whether inside a Void or not, clinging to her laptop.</p><p>Even the Saintess, who constantly monitored Awakeners, didn’t notice anything amiss. When she saw Dok-seo typing away, the Saintess merely thought, <em>"She’s working hard to overcome her slump."</em></p><p>It would’ve been impolite to sneak a peek at a novel that hadn’t been written yet. After all, the "first reader" of Oh Dok-seo’s work was almost always the Undertaker.</p><p>So the Saintess paid no attention to the sentences forming on that laptop screen.</p><p>For seven years.</p><p>――――――――――</p><p><strong>How do I find the hidden opportunity in this Void?</strong></p><p><strong>How do I maximize my absolute defense ability?</strong></p><p><strong>I’ve started feeling guilty about seeing Mister lately. Tell me how to avoid overlapping schedules with him.</strong></p><p><strong>How to defeat Cheon Yo-hwa.</strong></p><p>――――――――――</p><p>As a result, the once-half-baked prophet Oh Dok-seo had grown more complete.</p><p>The birth of the Fallen One, the Ghostwriter.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>Footnotes:</p>
