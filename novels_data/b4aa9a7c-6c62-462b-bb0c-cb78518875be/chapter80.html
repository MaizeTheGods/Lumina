<p>Promoted Ⅰ</p><p>Speaking of wishes, it's more accurate to say that I grant them rather than make them.</p><p>[Time Seal].</p><p>My unique awakening ability and the reason why my nickname as the Undertaker stuck. It traps the target in their 'happiest day,' forcing them to relive that day for eternity.</p><p>-Undertaker, it's too hard. I want to let go of life now.</p><p>-Please, Undertaker.</p><p>-I want to see my family. Back when the world was still intact, with my family... Please.</p><p>-No one in reality remembers me anymore? It doesn't matter. This world is already...</p><p>Though they relive the same day forever, those under [Time Seal] never realize it.</p><p>Even if, like the soccer player Kim Joo-chul from a previous episode, they somehow notice, it doesn’t matter. They forget again quickly.</p><p>People just play all day long in the dreamland amusement park I’ve set up, with an all-day pass.</p><p>To the end-of-the-world humanity, I am the ultimate, legally approved final sedative (with narcotic properties).</p><p>Naturally, there's a long line of people waiting to get into this amusement park with a free pass.</p><p>Today, let me introduce the craziest psychopath standing in that line.</p><p>“Vice guild leader.”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>“My life is too painful.”</p><p>Swooosh.</p><p>Silver hair fell across the table from the seat opposite me.</p><p>That hair was beautiful. Too white to be gray and too shiny to be white. It could only be described as silver.</p><p>When an awakener gains their powers, their hair color is randomly dyed. The person before me had lucked out with an SR grade in the tier gacha. (For reference, I got normal-grade black.)</p><p>“To be honest, it's too hard to bear sober. I want to end it all.”</p><p>“……”</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>Yu Ji-won.</p><p>There’s a person with that name.</p><p>In fact, Yu Ji-won has appeared several times in my stories. Some readers might remember, but her first appearance was here.</p><p>-Vice guild leader, do you have a moment? A guest has come to see you.</p><p>-A guest? Who?</p><p>-Yes, the name is... Emim... Schopenhauer? They said they're German.</p><p>The day I first met the old Schopenhauer.</p><p>The one who first told me a historic moment had arrived, a German geezer visiting, was none other than the SSS-class hair beauty Yu Ji-won, my secretary and lieutenant.</p><p>Yes, my secretary and lieutenant. Long ago, when I was just a lackey for Dang Seo-rin at Samcheon World, Yu Ji-won was my lackey. The lackey of the supreme guild leader's lackey—quite a high rank.</p><p>Let me introduce how this person got into the core circle of power, our inner circle, in one fell swoop.</p><p>It was during the 5th cycle. Yu Ji-won said something to me then.</p><p>“Vice guild leader, do you like Romance of the Three Kingdoms?”</p><p>“What? You too?”</p><p>“Yes. I got into it when I was a kid with Yokoyama's 60-volume strategy Three Kingdoms.”</p><p>My eyes lit up. Such pedigree.</p><p>The cool and chic awakener with silver hair moved only her lips to mutter.</p><p>“After that, I read Go Woo-young’s Three Kingdoms, Hwang Sok-yong’s Three Kingdoms, Yi Munyeol’s Three Kingdoms, and Jang Yeong-sil’s Three Kingdoms. I briefly got into the niche Three Kingdoms commentary before moving on to the Romance of the Three Kingdoms Battle Records and eventually delving into the original historical texts.”</p><p>“Incredible.”</p><p>I was dizzy with excitement. It was an intoxicating feeling, like a drug.</p><p>Is this how a martial arts elder feels when they see a promising disciple?</p><p>My voice trembled as I asked, testing if this kid was the successor to carry on my legacy.</p><p>“KOEI...? Or, Three Kingdoms: Total War...?”</p><p>“Hmm.”</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>As is common in zen dialogue, Yu Ji-won rested her chin on her hand in thought.</p><p>Finally, she lifted her glasses.</p><p>“My rational mind calls for Three Kingdoms: Total War, but my young heart cries out for KOEI. And I believe the soul resides in the heart rather than the brain.”</p><p>“…Which series do you prefer?”</p><p>“Three Kingdoms 3, Three Kingdoms 5, Three Kingdoms 11.”</p><p>“Gasp...!”</p><p>I had no choice but to acknowledge her excellence. From that moment, Yu Ji-won was immediately selected as my close aide.</p><p>Of course, there was one final hurdle.</p><p>“Oh, for crying out loud. Kids.”</p><p>Samcheon World, which had adopted a global monarchical system over a democratic one, had its own procedures and regulations.</p><p>Our supreme leader, the Great Witch Dang Seo-rin, sneered at us.</p><p>“Hiring someone as the vice guild leader's aide just because they're a Three Kingdoms otaku? The guild’s management must be thriving.”</p><p>“It's ironic coming from a witch otaku and train enthusiast...”</p><p>“What did you just say, vice guild leader?”</p><p>“Nothing at all.”</p><p>“I understand you like her, but you can't promote guild members recklessly without procedure. How will Yu Ji-won feel if she rises through the ranks without proper process? Her peers will resent her.”</p><p>“If I may, Great Witch, can I speak?”</p><p>Yu Ji-won said.</p><p>As described several times, Yu Ji-won always wore an expressionless face and spoke with discipline. She had a talent for making even the most nonsensical words sound plausible when they passed her lips.</p><p>“Hmm? Go on.”</p><p>“I wasn't recommended for the position of vice guild leader's aide just because of my Three Kingdoms knowledge. I have other skills as well.”</p><p>“What, your awakening ability? The minimap thing? I know that. I value you too. But as I said, organizations need procedure and order…”</p><p>“I majored in Latin and can write freely in Latin. Naturally, I can also translate song lyrics into Latin.”</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>“Promoted.”</p><p>Yu Ji-won, appointed to the executive level!</p><p>Yu Ji-won’s promotion to the inner circle was thanks to her knowledge of Three Kingdoms and her Latin skills, but that didn’t mean she was incompetent as an awakener.</p><p>In fact, she was quite capable.</p><p>“Ji-won.”</p><p>“Yes, vice guild leader.”</p><p>“It’s about time to start the operation. Turn on the minimap.”</p><p>“Yes, sir.”</p><p>Minimap.</p><p>This was Yu Ji-won's awakening ability. Any Korean who had sold their soul to the ethnic game StarCraft would instantly understand what the 'minimap' ability was just by hearing its three-syllable name.</p><p>Swoosh-</p><p>Yu Ji-won spread a map on the operation table. The scale was 1:50,000. She placed the chess pieces she had prepared on the map.</p><p>Amazingly, the chess pieces began to move on their own.</p><p>“Vice guild leader, the enemy is gathering in the eastern district as expected. They seem to be planning to use boats to attack us from behind.”</p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p>The seemingly ordinary chess pieces had red stickers with names like 'Kim Sung-woo' and 'Park Hyun-mo' written on them.</p><p>All were names of the enemy leaders we were up against.</p><p>The chess pieces imitated the locations and movements of the enemies on the map. It wasn’t just the enemies.</p><p>♝                 ♛</p><p>Yu Ji-won  Dang Seo-rin</p><p>The bishop labeled 'Yu Ji-won' and the queen labeled 'Dang Seo-rin' also accurately showed their positions on the map.</p><p>Dang Seo-rin was impressed.</p><p>“It really feels like fighting with a minimap on. This ability is broken. Ever since Ji-won joined Samcheon World, guild wars have become so easy.”</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>“You flatter me, Great Witch.”</p><p>Yu Ji-won, the master of social skills, bowed at a perfect angle—neither too exaggerated nor too stiff.</p><p>“My ability has limits. Without your leadership, my ability would be useless.”</p><p>“That's too much flattery. Be careful, or I might sew your mouth shut.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Yu Ji-won was just pretending to be modest while flattering, but her ‘minimap’ had some flaws.</p><p>1. The minimap only displayed targets Yu Ji-won had met and knew by name.</p><p>For instance, Yu Ji-won couldn’t display the 'Saintess' on the minimap. She had never met her and didn’t know her name.</p><p>2. The minimap only worked in cities Yu Ji-won had physically visited.</p><p>For example, in the 5th cycle, Yu Ji-won had never been to Gyeongju. Despite being a cycling enthusiast who toured all of Korea and even Japan, she had never set foot in Gyeongju.</p><p>So no matter how much she used the minimap, she couldn’t track anyone fleeing to Gyeongju.</p><p>In such cases, the chess pieces would move until they reached the edge of the map and then fall over.</p><p>The expression 'set foot in the city' might seem vague, but it had a very clear criterion: visiting a convenience store in the city.</p><p>Oddly enough, if Yu Ji-won bought something or stayed in a convenience store in a city for more than a minute, that city was considered 'visited.'</p><p>So, cities where convenience stores had completely disappeared couldn’t be ‘visited.’ For instance, in New York, which was devastated by an ocean-class anomaly, there were no convenience stores to be found.</p><p>In other words?</p><p>“Guild leader, I'll take Ji-won to various guild leader meetings and travel across the country.”</p><p>“Sure. Please do.”</p><p>I dragged Yu Ji-won around the country under the pretext of being my secretary, making her familiarize herself with people’s faces.</p><p>As a result, the ‘vast network’ that Yu Ji-won built through me was reflected on a map of the entire Korean Peninsula.</p><p>“Impressive.”</p><p>I looked down at the huge map and opened a beer bottle.</p><p>The major guild leaders of each city, those with special abilities even if they weren’t guild leaders, and anyone who could influence the power dynamics in Korea.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>The locations of all these important figures were displayed in real time.</p><p>“Thank you. It's all thanks to you, vice guild leader.”</p><p>“It’s your skill and your major that paid off.”</p><p>“I never expected my Latin major to shine more after the world ended. I used to worry about starving before the apocalypse.”</p><p>“Isn’t it life’s unpredictability?”</p><p>I slowly poured beer into Yu Ji-won’s proffered glass. We raised our glasses to celebrate the completion of the ‘national map.’</p><p>“Cheers.”</p><p>“Cheers.”</p><p>Clink— The glasses made a lovely sound.</p><p>With Dang Seo-rin's leadership, my support, and Yu Ji-won's overwhelming information-gathering ability, Samcheon World continued to prosper.</p><p>It would be nice if this invincible triumvirate lived happily ever after... but as you all know, this story is far from a happy ending.</p><p>Shortly after we ascended to power in Korea, the situation grew increasingly grim.</p><p>In cycles without Noh Do-hwa, the cities were isolated and perished one by one. In cycles without the SwordMarquess, food supplies dwindled rapidly. In cycles without Seo-gyu, the Awakeners lost their communication network. In cycles without Old Man Scho, we lacked the strength to break through the anomaly's onslaught.</p><p>Even for the executives of Samcheon, the situation was dire. Maybe even worse.</p><p>Dang Seo-rin, the supreme leader in our autocratic system, was a rare breed—a 'benevolent ruler.'</p><p>Executives had to set an example at the front lines, and if even one guild member starved, so did the executives.</p><p>Dang Seo-rin endured. I endured well.</p><p>Yu Ji-won struggled.</p><p>Despite her cool and chic persona with silver hair, Yu Ji-won had the words ‘power’ and ‘promotion’ inscribed on her heart. For her, the dire situation was unbearable.</p><p>The brutal truth was that Samcheon World was still the best off in Korea.</p><p>Yu Ji-won, who needed power and success to be satisfied, was tormented by the environment that refused to fulfill her desires.</p><p>If there had been a guarantee of success in another guild, Yu Ji-won might have followed the example of Prime Minister Ye Wanyong of the Great Korean Empire and defected.</p><p>In reality, Yu Ji-won had every intention of continuing her ancestors’ legacy.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>“Vice guild leader.”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>“Could you arrange a boat to Japan?”</p><p>I didn't bother to lecture her, 'Why run away to Japan? Aren't you ashamed as the vice guild leader’s aide?'</p><p>Instead, I sipped my coffee. By this time, I had started to see through Yu Ji-won's true nature.</p><p>“I could arrange one, but it would be a one-way ticket.”</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“Until recently, there were Japanese ships occasionally coming to Busan. But they’ve all disappeared since three months ago. What does that tell you?”</p><p>“……”</p><p>We fought bloody battles against anomalies across the country with our guild alliance. Yu Ji-won, as my direct subordinate, was always with me.</p><p>“Vice guild leader, what about China...”</p><p>“Based on what the constellations said, Shandong is out of the question.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“And you said your [Minimap] works in Korea and Japan but you’ve never been to China. Your ability would be useless there. Are you okay with that?”</p><p>“……”</p><p>Indeed, betrayal requires someone to accept you, and escaping needs a paradise to run to.</p><p>The times were turning her into an eternal loyalist.</p><p>Just as talented people born in the wrong era often do, Yu Ji-won finally acknowledged that her desires would never be fulfilled.</p><p>She had nowhere to go. Where could she go when the whole world had collapsed?</p><p>Actually, there was one last place to run to.</p><p>“Vice guild leader.”</p><p>“Oh, for crying out loud. Lieutenant Yu! Are you scared? Let’s just die together. Life is short anyway. We’re all doomed soon...”</p><p>“Please kill me.”</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>I turned my head.</p><p>My expressionless lieutenant was staring at me.</p><p>“Give me a funeral. With your power. Please.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>I sighed.</p><p>There were many who had asked me for a funeral... that is, [Time Seal].</p><p>Sure. Some of them were personally important to me.</p><p>In short, I was a professional undertaker. I had already experienced sending close acquaintances into eternal caskets multiple times.</p><p>And I knew that when people I had seen through and through asked for a funeral, I could offer a slightly more detailed consultation than usual.</p><p>To summarize the consultation in one line:</p><p>-I'm a regressor. The wheel of time will turn to the next cycle, and the world will be a bit better. Are you sure you want to be sealed now?</p><p>Upon hearing my secret, Yu Ji-won was shocked. Her mental shock lasted exactly six hours.</p><p>Less than a day later, my silver-haired lieutenant came back.</p><p>“Your excellency, you said this is the 5th cycle.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>It’s evident she was a tough nut to crack since she started addressing me as ‘your excellency’ the moment she heard I was a regressor.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Well, then wouldn’t it be logical to think that the 2nd cycle would be better than the 1st, the 5th better than the 4th, and the 6th better than the 5th?”</p><p>“…That’s true.”</p><p>My silver-haired lieutenant nodded seriously.</p><p>Then she began to say something I had never heard in my entire regressor life.</p><p>“Your excellency, I believe getting sealed in time now, in the 5th cycle, would be a significant loss.”</p><p>?</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>Footnotes:</p>
