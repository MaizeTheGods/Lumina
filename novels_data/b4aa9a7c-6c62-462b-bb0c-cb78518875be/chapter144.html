<p>The Lucky One III</p><p>The luck didn't end.</p><p>While the Reverse-Great Wall was engaged in an infinite defense game against the onslaught of the continent, 'fortuitous encounters' kept happening.</p><p>[Mr. Undertaker, the 'pink entity' you warned about has been confirmed to have moved to Kyushu, Japan.]</p><p>Go Yuri, the greatest enemy of regressors and a master of gaslighting, had voluntarily left Korea.</p><p>This unprecedented good news made me want to give her a generous relocation settlement.</p><p>And that wasn't all.</p><p>[The Status Window anomaly didn't appear.]</p><p>“What?”</p><p>[We focused on the date and location you provided, but no one saw the Status Window.]</p><p>“......”</p><p>[This must also be due to the 'Monkey's Paw.']</p><p>And that wasn’t all².</p><p>Luck didn't just unfold in the physical world. Even in the net community, my luck didn't waver.</p><p>In short, a wave of Three Kingdoms parodies swept through the novel serialization board on SG Net.</p><p>-Lü Bu Hides His Father (★9.9)</p><p>-Ten Attendants General (★8.7)</p><p>-[Alternative History] Ordered to March North but Woke Up in Hanzhong Instead of North Korea?! (★9.2)</p><p>-The Three Brothers Always Slept Under the Same Blanket [19+ Complete Version] (★9.8)</p><p>-Reincarnated as Zhang Kai, Who Killed Cao Cao’s Father on the First Day (★9.9)</p><p>-Reincarnated as a Yellow Turban Rebel with a Copy of Capital in My Hand (★9.6)</p><p>Everywhere you looked, the rankings were dominated by Three Kingdoms parodies.</p><p>These days, the Three Kingdoms was totally YOUNG and MZ content.</p><p>Not only the novel serialization board but also the free board, which was the main part of SG Net, was filled with Three Kingdoms discussions without cooldown.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>-Anonymous: I thought the Three Kingdoms &lt;&lt;&lt; was just content for old people, but after reading the novel and the history book, there's nothing like it.</p><p>-Anonymous: How great was Ma Su’s mountain climbing? Let’s find out by forming a mountain climbing team for a trip to China. We'll schedule it according to each guild’s vacation time. Sorry, but due to safety concerns abroad, we only accept participants capable of diving to a depth of 600 meters or more. Interested? Contact me!</p><p>-dolLHOuse: What’s wrong with SG Net these days? Did everyone get prescription reading glasses?</p><p>└Anonymous: There’s still a full HP newbie who hasn’t read the Three Kingdoms? LOL</p><p>└dolLHOuse: I read it?</p><p>└Anonymous: So, which faction do you support?</p><p>└dolLHOuse: Anyone but the big-eared guy. Aren’t all the characters just commoners who end up with the Five Barbarians and Sixteen Kingdoms ending?</p><p>└Anonymous: Blocking you.</p><p>-[Samcheon] WitchJudge: The night sky is beautiful tonight. Did the Prime Minister feel this way when he looked up at the stars in Wuzhang Plains?</p><p>-OldManGoryeo: Wow, seriously, I want to bury all these idiots in a coffin.</p><p>-[NRMC] Officer: We have a group in Busan that reads and discusses the original Three Kingdoms history every week. (4/6)</p><p>Before I knew it, I had been engrossed in my smartphone for six hours straight, unable to take my eyes off the community.</p><p>“Whew.”</p><p>I shivered.</p><p>I had always nagged Ah-ryeon to quit her internet addict lifestyle.</p><p>Now, for the first time in 590 cycles, I understood the true joy of community engagement.</p><p>‘Is this the true power of the Monkey's Paw?’</p><p>I couldn't tear myself away from SG Net.</p><p>It felt as if the smartphone screen was coated with honey made by a master craftsman just for me, the Undertaker!</p><p>“Cursed Monkey's Paw! This is a power that would have already bewitched an ordinary human!”</p><p>“......”</p><p>As Ha-yul passed through the living room, she looked at me as if I were pathetic, like a diligent younger sister would look at her unemployed older brother.</p><p>Indeed.</p><p>In the 590th cycle, I was experiencing what it was like to live the hopeful life of a cult leader.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>Everything in the world was going my way!</p><p>Every business venture I touched progressed miraculously, and troubles I couldn't handle never occurred in the first place.</p><p>But I was not a cult leader.</p><p>I was an ordinary citizen who preferred the subway to a limousine. Therefore, I could sense that the name of my next stop was 'ruin' without looking at the map.</p><p>It was now the 7th year.</p><p>The 10th-year deadline I had asked the Monkey's Paw to postpone was fast approaching.</p><p>‘Should I just kill myself?’</p><p>A drastic decision was needed.</p><p>‘Suicide’ was a route anyone who had lived a debtor’s life for seven years could empathize with. For a regressor, it wasn’t even that extreme.</p><p>I could just send a message on KakaoTalk saying, 'Thanks to the Total Luck Law, I enjoyed this cycle a lot^^ I'll see you in the next cycle...', and then leave the chat room, safely escaping from future debts.</p><p>Leaving this Three Kingdoms paradise was regretful, but a regressor must know how to set aside personal desires temporarily.</p><p>“Ah... I wouldn't recommend that, teacher.”</p><p>An expert had a different opinion.</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“Hmm. It might make things worse.”</p><p>Cheon Yo-hwa, who listened to my concerns, gave a wry smile.</p><p>Why did I confide such a delicate matter to Cheon Yo-hwa? Because, among our members, she was the only one besides me who had a 'paranormal expert' identity.</p><p>As everyone knew, Cheon Yo-hwa had sealed the Infinite Void inside an hourglass.</p><p>Counting the anomalies from school ghost stories, she carried around about 100 Pokémon in her arsenal.</p><p>Other trainers would have sued her for exceeding the Pokémon carrying limit.</p><p>Fortunately, this world wasn't about forcing sadistic beasts to fight in a coliseum, but still, the anomalies rightfully harbored resentment towards their warden.</p><p>Led by the Infinite Void, the Hundred Tales of anomalies constantly plotted rebellion whenever they had the chance.</p><p>Cheon Yo-hwa didn't gorge on tteokbokki at the snack bar near her school every day for no reason.</p><p>Like the Saintess, the more powerful an awakener was, the closer they were to the risk of corruption.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>“You think things will get worse?”</p><p>“Yes. It’s just my guess, though.”</p><p>“Well. The last time I checked, the 'Monkey's Paw' couldn't detect regression. It didn't have the power to give regression ability to Kuro, its original owner. So if I just close my eyes and regress, won't the debt disappear?”</p><p>“Ahaha. But because of that Kuro, the 'Monkey's Paw' ended up applying to everyone, not just one individual, right?”</p><p>“......”</p><p>“It seems like people think they are parasitic on the 'Monkey's Paw,' but I think it's the opposite. The 'Monkey's Paw' is parasitic.”</p><p>“A anomaly that parasitizes humans?”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Cheon Yo-hwa clapped her hands.</p><p>Despite the serious conversation, she seemed to enjoy sharing this kind of talk with me.</p><p>After all, competing for dominance with a near-divine anomaly 365 days a year, she probably saw me as a valuable conversation partner.</p><p>There weren’t many people who could empathize with the terror of anomalies like us.</p><p>“Think about it, teacher. The 'Monkey's Paw' can't get stronger on its own. It needs someone to make wishes to use those wishes as an excuse to increase its power.”</p><p>“Hoh.”</p><p>“To the 'Monkey's Paw,' Kuro must have been a blessing. If someone had made ordinary wishes, the 'Monkey's Paw' would have remained a mediocre anomaly. But because Kuro made such high-level wishes, the 'Monkey's Paw' grew just as powerful!”</p><p>“So if a regressor like me decides to run away, thinking that regression will solve everything...”</p><p>“The 'Monkey's Paw' might transcend regression and gain control over luck and misfortune. This is just a hypothesis.”</p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p>“So I don’t recommend suicide. Besides, I don’t want to see you dead, teacher. Hehe...”</p><p>She had a point.</p><p>Even I, who criticized Kuro’s stupidity, ended up making the same foolish mistake.</p><p>The 'luck of an ordinary person' and the 'luck of a 590-cycle regressor' were inherently different.</p><p>Just consider the scale of what the 'Monkey's Paw' did this cycle.</p><p>It reversed the aging of a senile Sword Marquess.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>It summoned the Meteor Shower to the East Sea earlier than expected, and perfectly timed a UFO to collide with it.</p><p>As a result, a Black Wall, which should never have existed, was created in the north of the Korean Peninsula.</p><p>In other words, the 'Monkey's Paw' had grown powerful enough to cause such high-level 'fortuitous encounters.'</p><p>According to the Library Association's classification, it should now be evaluated as an ocean-level threat.</p><p>‘Have I really gotten myself into a deep mess?’</p><p>A sense of urgency crept in.</p><p>I had to resolve the situation before misfortune truly struck.</p><p>“On the contrary, I think you need to survive as persistently as possible in this cycle.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“If you die without experiencing the equivalent misfortune for the luck you enjoyed, that 'unpaid misfortune' might carry over to the next cycle.”</p><p>“Hmm...”</p><p>I stroked my chin.</p><p>Talking with Cheon Yo-hwa stimulated my brain in a way I couldn’t quite describe.</p><p>‘Wait. Something good is about to come to mind...?’</p><p>At this point, I hadn't figured out the 'good idea' specifically. That would be covered in the .</p><p>However, I had grasped the general direction.</p><p>“So, according to you, I should try to be as unfortunate as possible from now on.”</p><p>“Haha. ...Yes. But deliberately seeking misfortune isn’t exactly something you can control. It’s tricky.”</p><p>“No, there is a way. A very subtle method.”</p><p>“Oh? Really?”</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>Then I spoke with utmost seriousness.</p><p>“Yo-hwa.”</p><p>“Yes, teacher.”</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>“Have you heard of the 'Hate Pill'?”</p><p>“...?”</p><p>‘Hate Pill.’</p><p>There is a genre, a sort of meme about it.</p><p>Cheon Yo-hwa tilted her head as if she had never heard of it, which made sense. Its origin was from across the sea in Japan.</p><p>Some people think Japan lacks creativity and originality.</p><p>-Tonkatsu? Isn’t that just a variation of cutlet?</p><p>-Japanese curry? It’s just Indian curry adjusted to Japanese taste.</p><p>But that’s a misconception.</p><p>If you remove the [General Audience] filter from your corneas, you’ll suddenly witness the creativity erupting from the Japanese archipelago like Mount Fuji.</p><p>After all, Japan is the birthplace of turning Three Kingdoms characters into gender-swapped 'TS Three Kingdoms' or erotic parodies.</p><p>There were many other inventive creations that were too controversial to mention.</p><p>Only ancient Greece had previously shown such creative power. (The Greeks impregnated their chief god’s thigh and dressed their greatest hero in women’s clothing.)</p><p>Anyway.</p><p>The ‘Hate Pill’ was another example of Japan’s vibrant creativity.</p><p>-This pill reverses affection!</p><p>-It reverses affection?</p><p>-Yes. People who liked you will hate you just as much. Literally, a 'Hate Pill.'</p><p>-...?</p><p>-People who subtly showed affection towards you will suddenly curse you, wishing you dead! Don’t worry, those who already disliked you will continue to do so!</p><p>-Why would you introduce such a pill into a story?</p><p>-Because the effect has an expiration date.</p><p>-...??</p><p>-After the effect ends, people will start to regret. They’ll see how much the protagonist suffered due to their curses and think, ‘What have I done to the person I liked? How could I say such terrible things...?’</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>-What’s the point of that?</p><p>-Isn’t it delicious to see characters regret after mistreating the protagonist?</p><p>-...???</p><p>Building a narrative over dozens of chapters to make the protagonist unhappy was highly inefficient from a practical standpoint.</p><p>Modern readers, who always seek efficiency, wanted to slap #regret #obsession #despair tags on their stories.</p><p>The solution was the ‘Hate Pill.’</p><p>An instant 3-minute meal for unhappiness created by the Japanese.</p><p>In short, it was an 'Affection Reversal Pill.' Just take it to become unhappy.</p><p>How did I, the Undertaker, come to know about this obscure foreign genre?</p><p>Well...</p><p>Again, this was a story that happened around the 590th cycle.</p><p>And I devoured all the web novels, resorting to “Misery” tactics with authors around the 560th cycle.</p><p>End of explanation.</p><p>“So you plan to take the 'Hate Pill' to intentionally cause 'misfortune' and escape the Total Luck Law’s grasp?”</p><p>“You understood well.”</p><p>“You’re truly crazy in a refined way.”</p><p>Oh Dok-seo, the one who introduced me to web novels and the only one among my companions who knew about the 'Hate Pill,' nodded.</p><p>“It's a great idea. As expected of my protagonist. Let’s test it immediately!”</p><p>By the way, Oh Dok-seo loved despair stories.</p><p>“But where do we find the Hate Pill? It’s not mentioned in ORV.”</p><p>“Ah. Dok-seo. Ginseng is sourced from Joseon, and queue cuts are from Qing. It’s clear where to farm the Hate Pill.”</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>That’s right.</p><p>We immediately set sail for the 'origin.'</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>Footnotes:</p>
