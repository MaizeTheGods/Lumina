<p>The Unidentified One Ⅰ</p><p>Regressors are also people. Human beings.</p><p>I was far from an all-powerful deity.</p><p>Take Sim Ah-ryeon's case for instance. Who would have thought that the title of a Japanese web novel like '【Manga Serialization Soon】 I Thought I Was a Mere Pathetic Awakener, But This Time, I Turn Out to Be a Legendary Healer ~Saving Patients from the Brink of Death, They Call Me an Angel~【Releases 11/11】' would unfold.</p><p>Once again, being a regressor doesn’t mean knowing every secret.</p><p>Every so often, there are unsolvable riddles or events that might as well be called urban legends that find their way to me.</p><p>They're the events I reflect upon while sipping Old Man Scho’s café au lait, those 'What on earth was that?' kind of events.</p><p>Today, I'll introduce you to such a mystery.</p><p>Do you believe that there is balance in the world?</p><p>For instance, if there are scumbags among humans, there are also angels.</p><p>On internet forums where villains emerge, so too do popular stars whom people want to befriend.</p><p>-[Satisfaction] CookingQueen: Do you seek peace of mind? Join the Satisfaction Guild! Our main hub is in Daejeon!</p><p>On SG Net, CookingQueen has always been one such popular figure.</p><p>I myself only have good memories of this person.</p><p>"CookingQueen? I haven’t observed her for long, but she’s not a bad person. She takes good care of her guild members and even volunteers on Sundays. Personally, I believe there’s no one as trustworthy among the Awakeners as CookingQueen."</p><p>Witness 1: Saintess.</p><p>"Oh, you're asking if I know CookingQueen? She’s a really good member. I’ve seen all sorts of things managing SG Net, but I’ve never seen CookingQueen cause trouble. Boring? Not at all. She writes plenty of funny posts and doesn’t act all high and mighty. Ugh. If all members were like CookingQueen, I wouldn’t have to suffer like this..."</p><p>Witness 2: Seo Gyu.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>-[Satisfaction] CookingQueen: OldManGoryeo, I believe in the goodness planted deep within your heart. Why do you keep repeating these self-harming actions? If you have any concerns, please consult me.</p><p>-OldManGoryeo: Please... Stop... It’s my fault. I’m a son of a bitch and a bad guy, so don’t talk to me like that…</p><p>Witness 3: Sim Ah-ryeon.</p><p>All the Awakeners, each with their unique personality, unanimously testified that CookingQueen was a rare find in this day and age.</p><p>Even the Saintess, known for her stringent standards, did not skimp on the praise. Her testimony held extra credibility, as she could observe other Awakeners with her [Clairvoyance].</p><p>I, the one and only infinite regressor (since the other one went on long-term leave), had a good impression of CookingQueen as well.</p><p>-LiteraryGirl: This ZERO_SUGAR person... such a nosy brat.</p><p>└[Satisfaction] CookingQueen: To speak ill of others is actually to lower oneself. Every human is a mirror to me, and I am a mirror of all humans. Let us respect and be considerate of one another.</p><p>There are those who hide in the shadows and slander me, yet CookingQueen stands against them.</p><p>I know best how difficult a task it is to stand alone and fight for good while everyone around you does evil.</p><p>And so it was in the 89th run. Invigorated by ‘the unscratched lottery ticket’ Seo Gyu hitting the jackpot, I had since taken to recruiting new companions in each run. Having proven her integrity and steadfastness over past runs, CookingQueen was also one of my targets.</p><p>It wasn't because she personally took my side that I approached her.</p><p>“Greetings.”</p><p>“Hello.”</p><p>And enlisting CookingQueen was not a hard thing to do. Like Seo Gyu, she was popular for a reason.</p><p>At the starting point of my regression in Busan Station's main concourse, 399 individuals were summoned there, and among them was CookingQueen's main form.</p><p>“I would say it's safer to move together with others. Would you perhaps accompany me, at least until we leave Busan Station?”</p><p>“Oh. Yes, I would like that.”</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>The woman had rosy-hued hair. Her hair might have been dyed a flashy color, but her demeanor was calm. Hers was the sort of peace found and kept despite going through numerous trials in life.</p><p>There was an imbalance between her vivid hair color and mode of expression, but that awkwardness was not out of place but instead lent itself to a rather unique charm.</p><p>“Thank you. You can call me ‘Doc’ or just ‘Undertaker’ if you prefer. And what is your name?”</p><p>“Go Yuri.”</p><p>The woman who had been active on SG Net under the name CookingQueen in past runs, now smiled gently and calmly.</p><p>“Please, just call me Yuri, Doc.”</p><p>To get straight to the point, Go Yuri had absolutely zero combat-related abilities to speak of. Not just combat, either. The ability she had awakened, [Stealth], could barely be called useful. If Go Yuri had the talent of a sniper or assassin, then [Stealth] might have been put to good use, but as it was, Go Yuri truly had no talent for fighting.</p><p>“Ugh. Ah! Agh! I’m sorry! I’m sorry!”</p><p>She was getting pummeled by slimes, which were considered the weakest monsters.</p><p>Sim Ah-ryeon (who had also been recruited into my party around the 51st run) aggressively ripped the slimes apart.</p><p>“Oh, noona... You're pretty bad at this...”[1]</p><p>“Yes, it seems I have no talent.”</p><p>“It’s okay, I’ll protect you!”</p><p>“Thank you, Ah-ryeon.”</p><p>It was a beautiful display of camaraderie between party members, despite Sim Ah-ryeon being one of the weakest in combat herself.</p><p>Still, we did not expel Go Yuri from the party.</p><p>It wasn’t because we feared the story would turn into a genre of #regret #obsession #misery, but for purely rational reasons.</p><p>“Oh, Guild Leader.”</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>At 5 AM, a time of serene blue before the day begins, I was drinking café au lait in the guild house kitchen when Go Yuri hurried down from upstairs.</p><p>Having lived as a regressor for a long time, I still found it hard to get used to being called ‘Guild Leader’. The title was a bit special to me.</p><p>But I accepted the greeting without letting that show. “You’re up early.”</p><p>“Yeah, I wake up automatically around this time,” Go Yuri said, sheepishly scratching her cheek.</p><p>Plus 10 points.</p><p>Indeed, a sound and healthy lifestyle fundamentally involves going to bed early and waking up early. This belief hasn’t changed through my 100th or even 1000th runs.</p><p>Go Yuri peeked into the kitchen. “Guild Leader, you always seem to brew coffee in the morning, and our guild has ‘café’ in the name. Is it a hobby of yours?”</p><p>“It is. It wasn’t always, but an old friend was deeply knowledgeable about the subject. Somehow, I ended up getting into it as well.”</p><p>“That’s cool!” Go Yuri clasped her hands together to form a triangle, then tilted her head while grinning. “I think following a set pattern early in the morning is itself proof of diligence. It’s like a declaration, a refusal to let time simply pass one by. And yet, you’re relaxing with a coffee, which eases mental and physical tension. It's a wonderful habit, truly!”</p><p>A smile spread across my face. I had my own reasons for loving the dawn, but Go Yuri wasn't wrong either.</p><p>“We really connect in conversation," I commented. "Heading to water the flowerbed now?”</p><p>“Yes, the hydrangeas are blooming beautifully! I was worried whether the soil would take well, but I'm happy to see the blue come out so bright!”</p><p>Plus 30 points.</p><p>Indeed, lazy people spread the virus of indolence while diligent people emit the radiation of effort. The mere act of caring for a flowerbed unasked was commendable in and of itself. Watching her speak so logically and with such precision was simply heartwarming.</p><p>Whenever I spoke like that in front of the other party members, their responses were always lukewarm, somehow.</p><p>“Say, hyung.”</p><p>“What is it, Seo Gyu?”</p><p>“Hyung, you’re not that much older than me, but hearing you speak feels like I’m listening to a company manager...”</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>Uh-oh.</p><p>I frowned, and Seo Gyu quickly averted his gaze.</p><p>I handed a cup of coffee (brewed to taste as close as possible to bagged coffee) to the Saintess, and she was touched.</p><p>“I think Mr. Undertaker’s view is correct. All virtue originates from habit, and habit begins with diligence. Virtue without diligence creates a dilettante, a mere show-off.”</p><p>“That’s right, isn’t it? Indeed. Seo Gyu, you should also learn from Yuri and the Saintess.”</p><p>Seo Gyu made a puzzled expression. “…It’s strange. Our guild's average age is almost the youngest in the industry, but why does it feel like…?”</p><p>He mumbled in complaint, but fondness for Go Yuri was not unique to me but shared by all party members.</p><p>“Yuri! Let’s grab a beer after training! Our usual place is well-stocked this week!”</p><p>“Hey, Go Yuri. About managing SG Net...”</p><p>“Go Yuri, would you like to have lunch with me today...?”</p><p>Even the most wild and difficult members of the party turned as tame as donkeys in Go Yuri's presence.</p><p>In fact, that was precisely why I decided to keep Go Yuri around.</p><p>While we're on the subject, I should explain that Awakeners generally have bad temperaments. It’s not an absolute rule, but those with particularly twisted natures often have stronger abilities.</p><p>Our guild, for example, was made up of S- and A-class prospects. Emotional instability was rampant. Even Seo Gyu, seemingly docile in my presence, once went nuts at the Tutorial Fairy, shouting, “You fucking asshole!”</p><p>The Saintess... I trust her with my life, but it's hard to say she has a normal personality. She only occasionally discusses SG Net operations with Seo Gyu. Despite sending out more messages than anyone else, paradoxically, she disliked interacting with people.</p><p>In a guild filled with troublemakers, being friendly with everyone was no small feat.</p><p>‘The mental stability of the party members has greatly improved compared to previous runs.’</p><p>Plus 200 points.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>Affinity Level 7 achieved.</p><p>Even if Go Yuri only mastered [Stealth] and was nothing more than a normal person with a single hair out of place, it didn't matter.</p><p>As I often say, mental stability is crucial for humans. What’s the use of having the strongest combat abilities without it? Take Old Man Scho—a broken mind merely turns one from a 'show' to a 'no-show'.</p><p>“Yes, everyone. Let’s have lunch together.”</p><p>Go Yuri served as a bridge connecting all of the guild members.</p><p>Even Awakeners who normally growled at each other in previous runs were now tempered by her presence, which significantly reduced my burden.</p><p>“Go Yuri is really like a hearty Korean soup. Managing the organization has become unbelievably easier,” I whispered to the Saintess while observing the scene from a distance. “You know Hayul, right? The quiet one. Even they follow Go Yuri. At this rate, we might even be able to increase our member count to 20 or 30 without any issues.”</p><p>“......”</p><p>“Hmm?” I turned around at her silence, only to find the Saintess looking a bit dazed. Her usually clear eyes were slightly clouded. “Saintess?”</p><p>“Oh. Yes. Sorry, what did you just say?”</p><p>“It wasn’t anything important. Maybe you’re feeling the heat? Shall I get you some cold water?”</p><p>“...No, it’s fine,” the Saintess murmured. “It's just, I’m amazed by how someone can be so close with everyone. You know I'm quite the opposite.”</p><p>“Each personality has its strengths and weaknesses, doesn’t it? Maybe Go Yuri also has her struggles that she doesn’t talk about with others.”</p><p>“That’s a fair point.”</p><p>The 89th run felt good in many ways.</p><p>SG Net operations were all smooth sailing. The villainous OldManGoryeo, Sim Ah-ryeon, had successfully rebranded from an attention-seeker to an A-class healer.</p><p>With the Saintess’s flawless support and Go Yuri’s maxed-out charm and affability, our guild was more cohesive than ever before. We even captured all the fairies to garner nationwide support from the Awakeners.</p><p>It was a run where our power solidified both overtly and covertly.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>‘Maybe… Maybe this time, we might actually prevent the end of the world?’</p><p>Looking back on it now, I realize that sentiment must seem like nonsensical rambling, but at the time, I sincerely believed it might actually happen.</p><p>That was how I ended my satisfying day and went to bed.</p><p>The next day, I awoke and made to get up.</p><p>My rule was to rise immediately after waking without lazing around in bed.</p><p>“......?”</p><p>But on this day, for the first time in a very long while, I struggled to get out of bed.</p><p>It wasn’t because I suddenly learned the value of laziness.</p><p>I just stared blankly up at the ceiling.</p><p>The ceiling that had been spotless as ever before I went to sleep.</p><p>[Do not trust the one with pink hair.]</p><p>That familiar ceiling now bore an unfamiliar sentence.</p><p>Infinite regression has taught me many lessons.</p><p>One of those lessons was named ‘doubt’.</p><p>Old Man Scho, a fellow regressor, had said the same.</p><p><em>“Do not trust these Constellation things too much.”</em></p><p>Everyone believed in the existence of the Constellations without question. However, Old Man Scho pointed out their bias towards Koreans and never let go of his skepticism.</p><p>In the end, Old Man Scho was right. The Constellations were just a masquerade played by the Saintess for the entire nation.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>‘German.’</p><p>I thought about the sentence I saw in my room while having breakfast with the guild members.</p><p>‘It wasn’t written with a writing tool but carved with the tip of a knife. Then...’</p><p>I reached into my pocket and pulled out a dagger, the self-defense weapon I never parted with, even in sleep.</p><p>Inspecting the blade, I noticed a fine layer of dust and debris stuck to it. I would need to consult Uehara Shino for a detailed composition analysis, but at a glance, it seemed the same as the ceiling material.</p><p>Meaning…</p><p>‘Someone took the dagger from my possession and carved the sentence into the ceiling in German, a language only I would recognize. They did this without my noticing and bypassed all the security in my bedroom.’</p><p>Was that even possible?</p><p>‘Impossible.’</p><p>Even the headquarters of our guild, thanks to 'Puppeteer', a specialist in fortifications, were laced with fine 'cobwebs' across the ceilings.</p><p>Aside from Dang Seo-rin's guild train, there were no other headquarters with such a high level of security. At the very least, no one in our guild was capable of bypassing security and pulling off such a feat.</p><p>Maybe Old Man Scho could... No, even then. I had already identified his corpse at the start of the 89th run.</p><p>Ultimately, there was only one suspect.</p><p>‘Myself.’</p><p>I stared at my own reflection in the glass of water.</p><p>If I were the culprit, then I could easily ignore any and all adversities and commit the crime.</p><p>The problem was... no matter how much I racked my brain, I had no memory of carving that sentence into the ceiling.</p><p>‘Brainwashing? Sleepwalking? Split personality? Memory loss? Hypnosis?’</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>Countless possibilities surfaced.</p><p>Either way, it was one of two things.</p><p>‘Either someone is trying to sow discord between me and Go Yuri, or they are genuinely warning me about Go Yuri.’</p><p>Suddenly…</p><p>I turned my head, and my eyes met with Go Yuri, who was munching on a sandwich.</p><p>“......?”</p><p>Go Yuri smiled and continued eating her sandwich.</p><p>...My heart settled.</p><p>I followed her example and ate my own meal as if nothing had happened.</p><p>‘Never thought the near-legendary 89th run would have such a screwed-up event.’</p><p>In such a crisis, the only person I could consult was the Saintess. Not only did she know that I was a regressor, she also knew how to assess any situation with objective eyes.</p><p>“By the way, haven’t the Constellations been quiet lately?”</p><p>“Huh? You too? I haven’t gotten any messages since yesterday.”</p><p>“It feels a bit unnerving when they normally talk a lot and then suddenly go quiet, doesn’t it?”</p><p>I paused.</p><p>The casual chatter from the guild members at the table drifted my way, and I absentmindedly looked over at them. “The messages from the Constellations aren’t coming through?” I asked.</p><p>“Ah, yes, Guild Leader.”</p><p>“Isn’t there some talk about it on SG Net right now?”</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>A foreboding feeling washed over me.</p><p>Footnotes:</p><p>[1] Noona is the way Koreans address big sisters.</p><p>***</p>
