<p>The Traveler III</p><p>The atmosphere was tense. Silent glares and psychological warfare ensued among the Undertakers. If anyone drew their sword, it would trigger a battle royale.</p><p>“Everyone, stay your swords.”</p><p>I, the most just and rightful original Undertaker, spoke up. The other fake Undertakers turned to look at me, some with mustaches, others as women.</p><p>- What? Are you asking to be killed first?</p><p>“No, upon deeper reflection, killing each other isn’t the best plan.”</p><p>- Why not?</p><p>- Are you scared?</p><p>“You know taunting won’t work. This is a well-laid trap. If we start a massacre, it will lead to a disaster.”</p><p>Some Undertakers tilted their heads.</p><p>- A disaster?</p><p>“Yes. Let me ask you all, do you know about the ‘Jar of Solitude’?”</p><p>Solitude.</p><p>It’s a famous curse, like an ancient form of a Pokémon battle. First, the shaman places venomous insects into a jar and seals it. The battle begins when the jar is closed, continuing until only one insect remains, having consumed all the others.[1]</p><p>- Who doesn’t know that?</p><p>“Listen. If we start killing each other, what happens? Naturally, the strongest Undertaker will survive.”</p><p>I spoke under their intense gazes.</p><p>“The moment that happens, we define this plane as a ‘Jar of Solitude.’ The last survivor would be labeled as a ‘bug’ or ‘vermin.’ You might wake up one day as a bug.”</p><p>Sighs echoed throughout the plane.</p><p>- That makes sense.</p><p>- It’s a dilemma!</p><p>- If the plane lands, anomalies will double. If we start killing each other, we become bugs. What should we do?</p><p>- Wait.</p><p>A female Undertaker raised her hand. Her appearance was a blend of Dang Seo-rin, Noh Do-hwa, and the Saintess. She wore a barista outfit like me and had already killed about 20 other Undertakers. She was formidable.</p><p>- I get that killing each other makes us the Jar of Solitude, but is turning into bugs that dangerous?</p><p>“Don’t you know the danger of bugs? Haven’t you seen the Giant Potato Robot Saintess statue in Busan?”</p><p>- Huh? Giant Potato... What?</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>Apparently, she didn’t know. I looked around disdainfully. Clearly, none of them knew.</p><p>“Let me explain. The Potato Robot Saintess is―”</p><p>A FEW MOMENTS LATER...</p><p>- That’s bullshit!!</p><p>- Unbelievable. That happened?</p><p>- My Saintess isn’t like that!</p><p>Chaos erupted among the Undertakers. Dang Seo-rins looked puzzled, wondering, “Who is the Saintess?” and “Who dared build such a statue in my Busan?”</p><p>Ignorance is bliss.</p><p>“Anyway, bugs are dangerous. The anomaly behind this plane likely has the power of a great god, perhaps even an Outer God.”</p><p>- I understand the danger of bugs...</p><p>- But what should we do then?</p><p>The female Undertaker asked.</p><p>“Simple. The curse of solitude relies on the insects killing each other. If the insects don’t fight and only one remains, the curse fails.”</p><p>- ......?</p><p>- Ah.</p><p>Some Undertakers blinked in confusion. It was surprising they managed to be regressors. But there were also perceptive ones.</p><p>The female Undertaker was among the latter.</p><p>- We need to commit suicide until one remains.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>My Dang Seo-rin looked shocked.</p><p>“Suicide? You all?”</p><p>- Yes. It’s the solution your Undertaker suggested. It selects the final survivor without fighting.</p><p>- Ah!</p><p>- Brilliant!</p><p>- A good strategy. This way, we avoid both the Outer God and the Jar of Solitude.</p><p>“No way... This is insane.”</p><p>Dang Seo-rin and the other Dang Seo-rins were dumbfounded, but the Undertakers exchanged knowing glances. Despite their different lives, appearances, and intelligence, one thing was constant.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>The possibility that one day, they might turn into an anomaly.</p><p>If that day came, every Undertaker was ready to erase themselves to prevent disaster.</p><p>“From now on, we’ll determine who is the most capable Undertaker. Through strength, intellect, or any other means. The losers will...”</p><p>- Recognize their shortcomings and leave, passing the mantle to the winner.</p><p>“Exactly.”</p><p>- Reasonable.</p><p>An Undertaker spoke.</p><p>- But there’s one problem.</p><p>- I don’t mind leaving the rest to another Undertaker. After all, there’s always the next cycle.</p><p>- But what about Dang Seo-rin?</p><p>All eyes turned to the Dang Seo-rins.</p><p>- What will happen to them?</p><p>- If you plan to kill them after we’re gone, we won’t commit suicide.</p><p>The atmosphere grew tense.</p><p>But I shook my head.</p><p>“No need to worry.”</p><p>- ......?</p><p>“Once you’re gone, Dang Seo-rin will be alone.”</p><p>I held Dang Seo-rin’s hand tightly. She glanced at me, but I focused on the Undertakers.</p><p>“But Dang Seo-rin didn’t just want to travel. She wanted to travel ‘with me.’”</p><p>- ......</p><p>“Once you’re gone, the Dang Seo-rins will disappear naturally. Trust me.”</p><p>Silence fell.</p><p>Then, one of them spoke.</p><p>- I believe you, 107.</p><p>He was also me.</p><p>Parallel worlds. Possible worlds. Multiverses.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>Leibniz, the philosopher who fought with Newton over calculus, first proposed these concepts.</p><p>A less-known concept is the ‘best of all possible worlds.’</p><p>- Our world is the best among all possible worlds, and thus the only one that exists.</p><p>Why do we live in this particular world and not another?</p><p>Why is our world the way it is?</p><p>- Because our universe is better than any other.</p><p>The best of all possible worlds.[2]</p><p>Other worlds have something fundamentally wrong. Physics might break down, or unimaginable evil might occur.</p><p>Even if our world feels awful, it’s the only one without a cosmic failure.</p><p>- I lost.</p><p>And so, we Undertakers began the task of determining the ‘best world.’</p><p>- You’re one step ahead of me. Using the Saintess’s telepathy and the possibility of falling into the solitude trap, you thought of it first. I should step back.</p><p>The 113th Undertaker accepted his fate calmly.</p><p>He held the hand of the 113th Dang Seo-rin.</p><p>- Sorry, Dang Seo-rin. We have to postpone our trip. I’m really sorry.</p><p>- It’s okay. Just being with you was enough.</p><p>Then, a shocking scene unfolded.</p><p>The 113th Undertaker and Dang Seo-rin embraced and kissed.</p><p>“Ugh.”</p><p>“Hmph.”</p><p>Both the original Dang Seo-rin and I were taken aback. Seeing someone who looked like me kiss someone who looked like her was surreal.</p><p>- Huh?</p><p>The real shock was yet to come.</p><p>Of the 100+ passengers, only we were surprised.</p><p>- What’s so shocking?</p><p>- Right? It’s just a kiss.</p><p>Indeed, the other Undertakers and Dang Seo-rins weren’t fazed at all.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>The real shock was that all the Undertakers and Dang Seo-rins were couples, except us.</p><p>“Unbelievable.”</p><p>“Oh my god.”</p><p>This plane was a group couple’s trip.</p><p>The other Undertakers and Dang Seo-rins planned overseas trips to celebrate anniversaries.</p><p>Except for us.</p><p>My head hurt. How could this happen?</p><p>- Actually, we’re the ones surprised...</p><p>- Really, you two aren’t a couple? THE Undertaker and Dang Seo-rin?</p><p>- Why? Why aren’t you dating?</p><p>They couldn’t understand why we weren’t together.</p><p>- If you’re not dating, why are you traveling together?</p><p>“Um, well...”</p><p>“I just wanted to travel,” the original Dang Seo-rin said. “I suggested the trip, and we left two days later.”</p><p>- Two days? And you just went to Uyuni Desert without being a couple?</p><p>“Yeah. Any problem?”</p><p>- Huh...</p><p>The Undertakers and Dang Seo-rins looked at us like we were the weird ones.</p><p>- Aren’t you the odd ones?</p><p>We didn’t answer that question.</p><p>Despite this minor incident, the task of determining the ‘best world’ continued smoothly.</p><p>Each test was different.</p><p>- I challenge you with the sword, 107. If you’re stronger, I’ll concede this life to you.</p><p>Sometimes, it was about strength.</p><p>- Ultimately, knowledge is key for a regressor. Let’s compete in knowledge, 107. How to grow allies, how to defeat anomalies.</p><p>Sometimes, it was about intellect.</p><p>- Even with a sharp sword and a brilliant mind, losing your sanity means falling to anomalies. How long can you maintain your sense of self, 107?</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>Sometimes, it was about mental strength.</p><p>- I don’t plan to drag this out. It’s all about luck. Let’s flip a coin, 107. Heads or tails?</p><p>Sometimes, it was just luck.</p><p>- Was Jiang Wei’s continuous Northern Expeditions in Three Kingdoms justified?</p><p>Sometimes, it was just about the Three Kingdoms... Was that really okay? Dang Seo-rin looked ready to kill him.</p><p>Anyway.</p><p>About 50 Undertakers challenged me in their own ways.</p><p>I won all those challenges.</p><p>In the end, no Undertaker was stronger than me. It was bittersweet but also a source of pride.</p><p>- In the end, determining the best world was my task.</p><p>The female Undertaker smiled sadly.</p><p>All other regressors accepted their end. She was the last remaining ‘me.’</p><p>- I thought I lived my best, but even that wasn’t the best.</p><p>The female Undertaker challenged me to a game of Go.</p><p>The game, where AI surpassed human champions, was a fitting test for a regressor’s memory.</p><p>I remembered countless Go games from many cycles. To me, Go was just a game of memory.</p><p>She challenged who could better utilize their memory.</p><p>- Well played.</p><p>“Well learned.”</p><p>I won by half a point with White.</p><p>- Sorry, Dang Seo-rin. We have to postpone our Oxford trip.</p><p>- It’s fine. We can always go ‘next time.’</p><p>The female Undertaker’s Dang Seo-rin smiled.</p><p>- Are you sure you’re okay with this?</p><p>- Yes. It was a fair result. Knowing that another ‘me’ is striving just as hard is a huge gain. I won’t lose next time.</p><p>- You just lost.</p><p>- I mean in the future.</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>The female Undertaker held her Dang Seo-rin’s hand.</p><p>Then she looked at me and smiled.</p><p>- I leave this world to you, 107. We’ll never meet again. If I’m human, I’ll buy the Saintess sunglasses when I return.</p><p>The female Undertaker’s body was enveloped in aura.</p><p>That was the final moment of the ‘Undertaker.’</p><p>There’s an epilogue.</p><p>Originally, our travel plan was to transit through Spain to South America. But after all the Undertakers left, the plane reached its destination.</p><p>The Uyuni Salt Flats.</p><p>The brightest mirror on Earth.</p><p>- Ah.</p><p>The plane landed softly on the water.</p><p>There was no vibration.</p><p>The plane’s wings cut through the transparent surface of the desert. Water trails stretched behind the plane.</p><p>Some Dang Seo-rins remained. Some followed their Undertakers in death, while others stayed by their bodies.</p><p>The door of the pilotless plane opened, letting the sunset reflect on the water into the cabin.</p><p>- Beautiful.</p><p>- Yeah, it’s beautiful.</p><p>- Now I see why I wanted to come here.</p><p>- Why is the world so beautiful just from a reflection...?</p><p>The Dang Seo-rins couldn’t continue.</p><p>As soon as the sunset touched them, they turned into white salt and crumbled instantly.</p><p>The white dust scattered in the desert wind.</p><p>Not just the Dang Seo-rins. The Undertakers’ bodies, the broken seats, even the plane’s structure crumbled into white salt.[3]</p><p>Like flower petals.</p><p>In the end, only Dang Seo-rin and I remained in the middle of the desert lake.</p><p>“......”</p><p>“......”</p><!--sse--><!--/sse--><p>Dang Seo-rin stared blankly at the dance of white petals. Each petal reflected the red of the sunset, and the reflection mirrored back to the horizon.</p><p>In a world where everything repeated, only our hands’ warmth was real.</p><p>Much later, Dang Seo-rin murmured, “What was that anomaly, Undertaker?”</p><p>“That...”</p><p>“I don’t need that kind of answer.”</p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p>I looked at the salt desert made of Dang Seo-rins and Undertakers’ remains.</p><p>“There are many reasons, but I think it was due to the ‘Uyuni Desert’ itself.”</p><p>Dang Seo-rin tilted her head. Her reflection in the water followed.</p><p>“Here? Why?”</p><p>“When the surface fills with water, it becomes a huge mirror. You know mirrors are the most dangerous objects in the void. We aimed for Uyuni Desert but ended up in the ‘Mirror World.’”</p><p>“Ah.”</p><p>“The plane is a means of travel ‘somewhere other than here.’ Our plane momentarily traveled to the Mirror World.”</p><p>“Right... That makes sense.”</p><p><em>Splash.</em></p><p>Dang Seo-rin stirred the water with her foot. Her smile reflected in the splashes.</p><p>“So my Undertaker is the best Undertaker, right?”</p><p>I didn’t answer that question.</p><p>“This place is really wonderful. Thank you, Undertaker.”</p><p>“You’re welcome.”</p><p>“But how do we get back to Korea? The plane just melted.”</p><p>“......”</p><p>I couldn’t answer that question.</p><p>I’ll just write that it took at least three months to cross the Pacific Ocean on foot.</p><p>Footnotes:</p><p>[1] <em>Mugo</em> or <em>Ko-dok</em>, literally “jar/curse of poison,” is a type of magic in which poisonous insects are sealed in a jar to kill each other until only the deadliest is left standing.
